<h1>GEOG5003 Programming for Geographical Information Analysis: Core Skills</h1>
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Welcome to the course website!</p>

<p>The course timetable is linked from the <a href="https://webprod3.leeds.ac.uk/catalogue/dynmodules.asp?Y=202223&M=GEOG-5003M">GEOG5003 Module Catalogue Page</a></p>
<p>The website is maintained by <a href="https://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/people/a.turner/index.html">Andy Turner</a> and comprises a set of webpages and file based resources.</p>
<p>At the top of each webpage is a Style Button that can be used
to change between a lighter and darker style. Below that is a
Navigation Section. Each webpage links to the next at the end. The
last pages are index and references pages. The index page contains
definitions for a lot of terms ans so is also a bit like a
glossary.</p>
<p>Essentially, the idea is that you - students taking the course
- read through the webpages trying out code and undertaking
practical exercises as directed.</p>
<p>Please contact your tutor by email or use the module Discussion
tool in
<a href="https://minerva.leeds.ac.uk/">Minerva</a> if you want
help or to clarify something or there is a problem with these
resources.</p>

</ul>
<p>Computer programming mostly involves computational thinking,
planning, problem solving and testing. It is often helpful to
break a task into smaller subtasks, and to think about the order
in which to do things. Often good solutions involve doing a
sequence of things repeatedly on some data stored in a data
structure.</p>
<!--<p>Often it is
helpful to use a framework for testing from the outset and to test
often as the code develops.</p>-->
<p>If you are new to computer programming, there is quite a lot of
terminology to get used to, some is generic to programming, some
is more specific to Python.</p>
<p>There are some key concepts to understand which may take
several attempts to learn fully.</p>

<h2 id="4">4. The Learning Journey</h2>
<p>Develop your understanding through practise and by reading.</p>
<p>Be experimental - test your understanding by testing code does
what you expect it to. If code does not do what you expect, try to
understand why - regard failure as a learning opportunity!</p>
<p>One of the keys to coding is learning to be able to interpret
errors messages - understand what caused them. If your program
generates an exception and error message, then try to understand
what happened before moving on. Ignoring errors is a bad idea!</p>
<p>Be cautious and do not run code that you do not fully trust. If
in doubt consult with your tutor.</p>

<p>The webpages with names starting "ABM" are a sequence of practicals that progress the development of a basic spatial <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent-based_model">ABM</a>. The ABM can be regarded as a simple model of autonomous spatial entities that move in an environment, interacting with the environment and each other.</p>
<p>Developing the ABM by following instructions puts into practise some of the theory detailed in other webpages. By the end of these practicals, you should have ABM model code that:</p>
<ul>
<li>has a basic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface">GUI</a>;</li>
<li>reads in data from local files and from the Web; and</li>
<li>produces an animation, data files and user friendly messages.
</li>
</ul>
<p>After completing the last ABM practical, you should have
sufficient knowledge and skill to develop the model further
without being given detailed instructions.</p>
<p>To complete the course, you are to undertake an independent
project to apply what you have learned to develop some different
software - there will be a specification of what the software is
to do, some guidance for approaching the software development
task, but no detailed instructions to follow.</p>
<p>Do not expect to master the Python language by the end of this
course. Usually this takes many years of practise.</p>
<p>Try to enjoy the learning journey, the challenges and the
rewards. Learning to program and learning Python is empowering!
</p>

<h2 id="5">5. Platform/Software</h2>
<p>All the software used in this course is

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software">Free and Open Source Software</a> (FOSS) - available to download and install on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">Linux</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows">Microsoft Windows</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/macOS">MacOS</a>.<p>
<p>The software is available via 'AppsAnywhere' at the University of Leeds which is accessible remotely via the 'Academic' <a href="https://wvd.leeds.ac.uk">University Windows Virtual Desktop</a>. The software includes: <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/">Anaconda</a> - a data science platform, <a href="https://qgis.org/">QGIS</a> Desktop - Geographical Information System software, and various third party Python packages.</p>
<h2 id="6">6. Assignments and Assessments</h2>
<p>There are two assignments that are assessed:</p>
<ol>

<li>Assignment 1 Portfolio worth 30% of the overall mark and due 28th April 2023 - developed by completing the ABM practicals.</li>
<li>Assignment 2 Independent Project worth 70% of the overall mark and due 12th May 2023 - developed by applying what you have learned to a software development task for which there is a specification and a suggested way to approach implementation, but no detailed instructions to follow. You should have sufficent knowledge and skill to sensibly begin this assignment from about half way through the course.</li>
<p>See the module page on Minerva for details of the assignments and how they are assessed.</p>
