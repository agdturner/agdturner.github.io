<h1>Agent Based Model Part 4</h1>
<h2 id="1">1. Recap and preparation</h2>
<p>Currently, 'agents' is a list that contains lists of two items
(an x coordinate and a y coordinate). More items could be added
to the lists to representing additional agent characteristics.
However, the longer the lists become, the harder it is to remember
what is stored in each index and the easier it is to make a
mistake.</p>
<p>Defining an Agent class provides a way to name agent
characteristics and refer to them by name rather than by a list
index. This will make the code a lot easier to read and
understand. The Agent class will be defined in a different file
from 'model.py' so the program code going forwards will be in
multiple files.</p>
<p>In your local code repository src directory create a new
directory called "abm4". Open Spyder and use 'save as' to save
your 'model.py' file from abm3 into the abm4 directory.</p>

<h2 id="2">2. Agent class definition</h2>
<p>Create a new file in the abm4 directory named
'agentframework.py', and add a class definition for an Agent class
in it as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class Agent():
    pass</code></pre>
<p>The keyword 'pass' ensures the code is syntactically correct
and will run.</p>
<p>In 'model.py' reduce n_iterations to 10, and add the
following import statement:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import agentframework as af</code></pre>
<p>Note that this imports the agentframework module from
'agentframework.py' which is to be referred to by the abbreviation
'af'.</p>
<p>At the start of the '# Initialise agents' code block, add the
following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">a = af.Agent()
print("type(a)", type(a))</code></pre>
<p>Run 'model.py' and examine the output. It should contain the
following line:</p>
<pre>type(a) <class 'agentframework.Agent'></pre>
<p>This indicates that an instance of the class Agent as defined
in the agentframework module was successfully created.</p>
<p>Add a constructor method to the Agent class that initialises
'x' and 'y' variable attributes to be random Integers in the range
[0, 99]:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import random

class Agent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.x = random.randint(0, 99)
        self.y = random.randint(0, 99)</code></pre>
<p>Note that for this to work, it was necessary to import the
random module.</p>
<p>In 'model.py', add a statement to print the agent that was
instantiated, and run the program again.</p>
<p>The new print statement should produce output that looks like
the following:</p>
<pre>&lt;agentframework.Agent object at 0x00000249AEA21D88&gt;</pre>
<p>The last part of your print statement will probably be
different to '0x00000249AEA21D88' and if you run your program
again, it will likely be different again. Recall that this string
is a memory address identifying where the object is stored in the
memory of the computer.</p>
<p>When printing an Agent instance, it would be better if
something more informative was output. The best way to do this
is to override the '__str__' method which comes from the 'type'
metaclass that all classes inherit from by default. Define the
method in the Agent class as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def __str__(self):
    return self.__class__.__name__ + "(x=" + str(self.x) \
        + ", y=" + str(self.y) + ")"</pre></code>

<p>Note that this returns a string which includes the name of the class and details of the 'x' and 'y' variable attributes which are transformed by the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-str">builtin function str</a> to be Strings.</p>
<p>Run model.py again and the print statement should now result in
the following:</p>
<pre>Agent(x=49, y=97)</pre>
<p>Change the "# Initialise agents" code section in model.py to:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Initialise agents
agents = []
for i in range(n_agents):
    # Create an agent
    agents.append(af.Agent())
    print(agents[i])
print(agents)</code></pre>
<p>Run model.py and you should get similar output to the
following (in the error report, the file paths will probably be
different, and the line numbers might be different if your code
is not exactly the same):</p>
<pre>Check this is equal to 5: 5.0
Agent(x=49, y=97)
Agent(x=53, y=5)
Agent(x=33, y=65)
Agent(x=62, y=51)
Agent(x=38, y=61)
Agent(x=45, y=74)
Agent(x=27, y=64)
Agent(x=17, y=36)
Agent(x=17, y=96)
Agent(x=12, y=79)
[&lt;agentframework.Agent object at 0x00000249B140C6C8&gt;, &lt;agentframework.Agent object at 0x00000249B14194C8&gt;, &lt;agentframework.Agent object at 0x00000249B1419148&gt;, &lt;agentframework.Agent object at 0x00000249B1419388&gt;, &lt;agentframework.Agent object at 0x00000249B14193C8&gt;, &lt;agentframework.Agent object at 0x00000249B1419448&gt;, &lt;agentframework.Agent object at 0x00000249B14191C8&gt;, &lt;agentframework.Agent object at 0x00000249B1419048&gt;, &lt;agentframework.Agent object at 0x00000249B1419488&gt;, &lt;agentframework.Agent object at 0x00000249B1419208&gt;]
Traceback (most recent call last):

  File "\abm4\model.py", line 95, in &lt;module&gt;
    print("Maximum distance between all the agents", get_max_distance())

  File "\abm4\model.py", line 81, in get_max_distance
    distance = get_distance(a[0], a[1], b[0], b[1])

TypeError: 'Agent' object is not subscriptable</pre>
<p>The agents list is initialised, but the print function does not
use the __str__ method to get a String representation of the
agents when printing the list.</p>
<p>The error is a consequence of the things stored in the agents
list no longer being lists, but instantiated Agent objects.</p>
<p>Add the following method to the Agent class to get the print
function to print String representations of agents when printing
the agents list:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def __repr__(self):
    return str(self)</code></pre>
<p>Like the method __str__(), the method __repr__() overrides from
the 'type metaclass', (for details see:
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#repr">
repr()</a>).</p>
<p>To prevent the error, it is necessary to refer to the
attributes of the agents as from the class definition and not to
items in lists (as agents are no longer lists, but are instances
of the class Agent). So, change the following line of code in
the get_max_distance() function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">distance = get_distance(a[0], a[1], b[0], b[1])</code></pre>
<p>To be:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">distance = get_distance(a.x, a.y, b.x, by)</code></pre>
<p>Examine the code change and appreciate that there is no longer
a need to remember which item in the list refers to a particular
coordinate.</p>
<p>Everywhere else in the model.py that was referring to a
coordinate from the agents list is to be changed similarly. Run
model.py to see where the next error is raised.</p>
<p>In the code "agents[i][0]" should be changed to "agents[i].x";
and, "agents[i][1]" should be changed to "agents[i].y". Make a
further change in the code block that plots agents, changing:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Plot the coordinate with the largest x red
lx = max(agents, key=operator.itemgetter(0))
plt.scatter(lx[0], lx[1], color='red')
# Plot the coordinate with the smallest x blue
sx = min(agents, key=operator.itemgetter(0))
plt.scatter(sx[0], sx[1], color='blue')
# Plot the coordinate with the largest y yellow
ly = max(agents, key=operator.itemgetter(1))
plt.scatter(ly[0], ly[1], color='yellow')
# Plot the coordinate with the smallest y green
sy = min(agents, key=operator.itemgetter(1))
plt.scatter(sy[0], sy[1], color='green')</code></pre>
<p>To:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Plot the coordinate with the largest x red
lx = max(agents, key=operator.attrgetter('x'))
plt.scatter(lx.x, lx.y, color='red')
# Plot the coordinate with the smallest x blue
sx = min(agents, key=operator.attrgetter('x'))
plt.scatter(sx.x, sx.y, color='blue')
# Plot the coordinate with the largest y yellow
ly = max(agents, key=operator.attrgetter('y'))
plt.scatter(ly.x, ly.y, color='yellow')
# Plot the coordinate with the smallest y green
sy = min(agents, key=operator.attrgetter('y'))
plt.scatter(sy.x, sy.y, color='green')</code></pre>
<p>Hopefully, you understand these changes and your program runs
without error and produces the same output as previously when you
have made all the changes.</p>
<p>Commit your code to your local repository and assuming you are
using GitHub - push your changes to GitHub.</p>

<h2 id="3">3. Separation of Concerns</h2>
<p>Define a method called move in the Agent class as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def move(self, x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max):</code></pre>
<p>Cut the code from the "# Move agents" loop that moves an agent
and insert it into the body of the new move method. Replace all
the instances of "agents[i]" with "self". Where the code was cut
from, add the following to call the move method:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">agents[i].move(x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max)</code></pre>
<p>In the Agent class, the move method has a parameter called
self, but this is not a parameter that is passed in. That self is
not passed in, is a difference between a method and a function in
python. Normally when calling a function the number of parameters
matches, but for methods (functions in a class) there is this
additional parameter that is not passed in and that is the first
parameter.</p>
<p>Run the program and it should produce the same results as
previously. The Agent class code now deals with the details of
how agents move, and the model.py code details when they do.
This is a reasonable separation of concerns for the model being
developed.</p>

<h2 id="4">4. Give each agent a unique name</h2>
<p>It is possible that two Agent class instances will be located
at the same coordinates at some iteration of the model, and it
would be helpful to distinguish them.</p>
<p>Add a docstring and a parameter to the constructor method of
Agent so that the method is as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def __init__(self, i):
"""
The constructor method.

 Parameters
----------
i : Integer
    To be unique to each instance.

 Returns
-------
None.

"""
self.i = i
self.x = random.randint(0, 99)
self.y = random.randint(0, 99)
pass</code></pre>
<p>Run model.py and you should get the following error:</p>
<pre>Traceback (most recent call last):

  File "\abm4\model.py", line 91, in <module>
    agents.append(agentframework.Agent())

TypeError: __init__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'i'</pre>
<p>The error message is that an expected argument is missing at
the line that is calling for the construction of an Agent
instance. Change model.py to pass in the missing argument 'i'. Run
the program again and the error should not be encountered.</p>
<p>Modify the Agent class __str__ method so it additionally
returns the unique characteristic of each Agent in the String.</p>
<p>Commit your code to your local repository and assuming you are
using GitHub - push your changes to GitHub.</p>
