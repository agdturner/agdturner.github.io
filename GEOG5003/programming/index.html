<h1>Programming</h1>
<h2 id="1">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming">Computer programming</a>
(coding) is about instructing computing machines (computers) to
carry out tasks where data is typically input, processed and
output.</p>
<p>Contemporary desktop and laptop computers typically have a
keyboard and mouse for user input, a visual display screen,
smaller amounts of faster more volatile data storage (memory), and
larger amounts of more persistent data storage (disk) that
is organised using a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system">file system</a>.
Computers may have inbuilt or perpherally connected devices such
as microphones and cameras, and the screen may be a touch screen.
Networked computers can typically communicate using standard
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet">internet</a> protocols.
The basic functioning of a computer is handled by an 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system">operating system</a>
 upon which additional 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software">software</a>
 can be installed, including software that interprets 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language">programming language</a>
 source code - a human readable form of computer instructions.
</p>
<p>Programming can be done visually by arranging and connecting
pre-built components into executable workflows. However, this
course is about programming using text based command instructions
that have a formal syntax. Some computer languages look similar,
some look very different. This course is mostly based on the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)">Python programming language</a> (Python).
<h2 id="2">2. Data</h2>

<h2 id="2.1">2.1 Binary</h2>
<p>In most modern computers, data is encoded in a binary form
where the smallest units called bits are in one of two possible
states: 0 or 1.</p>
<p>Typically computers work with fixed size collections of bits
called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte">bytes</a>.
The more bits there are in a byte, the more different unique
combinations or arrangements of bits there can be. With each added
bit, there are double the number of combinations. So, with 2
bits there are 4 possible combinations [00, 01, 10, 11]; with 3
bits there are 8 combinations [000, 001, 010, 100, 011, 101, 110,
111]; with 4, 16 combinations; with 5, 32 combination, and so on.
</p>

<h3 id="2.1">2.1 File Formats</h3>
<p>7 bits in a byte allows for (128 combinations) which is
suffient to represent all the letters in the English alphabet in
both lower and upper case, the ten numeric digits 0 to 9, and
64 other symbols. 7 bit bytes is the basis of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII">ASCII</a> - a
commonly used data encoding.</p>
<p>Data stored in files is often stored in standardised file
formats. A
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_format">
file format</a> is based on a (version of) a specification which
details what encdings are used and how all the data t be stored in
a file is organised.</p>
<p>Some file formats use different encodings in different parts.
Or use multiple bytes to represent things.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode">Unicode</a> is
a commonly used encoding. As of Unicode format version 15.0,
there are 149,186 characters that are uniquely encoded, including
various alphabets, mathematical symbols and emojis. Unicode uses
between 1 and 4 bytes of length 8 for encoding.</p>
<p>Commonly, there are multiples of 8 bits in a byte, but there
can be any number.</p>
<p>Often the suffix of a filename indicates the file format, for
example the file format of a file named "index.html" is expected
to be in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a>
format. Some file formats contain an identifying code (known as a
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_format#Magic_number>
magic number</a>) at the start indicating the file format.</p>

<h3 id="2.1">2.1 Encoding Numbers</h3>
<p>Individual integer numbers are typically represented using a
fixed number of bits that can map individually to every integer
number in a range. The encoding will detail how this is done and
what the range is. Usually, zero is either in the middle or at the
start of the range. To represent integer numbers beyond this
range, either the byte size must increase, or multiple bytes must
be used.</p>
<p>Floating point numbers include some integers and some fractions
in a range centred about zero. They are typically encoded using
either 32 or 64 bit bytes. The density of fractions within any
part of the range varies. In general, the density is greater
towards the centre of the range.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic">
Floating point arithmetic</a> has been standardised. The result of
a calculation is rounded to the nearest value in the range. So,
sometimes the result is accurate, sometimes it is rounded up and
sometimes it is rounding down. It is important to be aware that
there can be significant imprecision in this standardised
arithmetic.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-precision_floating-point_format">
Single precision floating point format</a> is a standard encoding
that uses 32 bits per number.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format">
Double precision floating point format</a> is a standard encoding
that uses 64 bits per number.</p>

<h2 id="3">3. Learning to Program</h2>
<p>Learning to program takes time and energy. It involves
developing and strengthening neural networks in your brain. It is
highly recommended that you organise to learn new programming
concepts when you are well rested and have good concentration.
Mistakes and misunderstanding is more likely if you are tired or
distracted.</p>
<p>Take breaks as you learn. They do more than help avoid fatigue.
They can help conceptually and with learning and over the duration
they probably save lots of time.</p>
<p>Saving your work periodically. Using

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control">version control</a>
helps to avoid costly mistakes and so is highly recommended.</p>
<p>Once you have a good grip of programming basics, as you should
have by the end of this course, good ways to improve your skills
are by getting involved in open source software development
projects and completing more advanced programming courses.</p>
<p>Being familiar with a programming language helps in learning
others. Many concepts are shared and the syntax is often similar.
</p>
<p>Some programming languages are particularly well geared for
particular applications. This can be a consequence of the langauge
fundamentals, but more often it is becasue something similar has
already been done with that langauge that you can build upon.</p>
<p>When given a choice, experienced programmers will often choose
a language to because they either know that language well - and
know how to approach the problem with it, or because they want to
learn/try something new.</p>
<p>Programming and programming language development are typically
community activities. It is normal to ask others for help and to
provide others with help and work collaboratively to develop
things. There are many different online forums that can be used
for this. Feel free to engage in online forums if you want, but
please do not post questions about this course. Ask your tutor or
a practical demonstrator if you want help.</p>
<p>There is a skill to asking for programming help. You might want
to show someone what is happening and talk about it. This is easy
to do in a classroom or shared office, but often that is not an
option, so the main alternative is to describe and detail the
issue by recording what happens and why this is different to what
you expect. Often the act of recording these details helps you to
understand better and come up with ideas to try - which may
ultimately resolve the issue before you ask for help. Don't see
this as wasted effort, the more times you practise detailing an
issue and the steps others need to take to replicate it, the
better you will be at this - and you want to be good at this in
order to get help which may strangely come from your future
self!</p>
<p>Often detailing an issue involves consulting documentation
and providing information about your environment. Sometimes the
issue is not that you have done something wrong, but that some
other code or software is not working as it should. Such issues
are commonly known as bugs. Writing a good bug report is an
important activity in software and language development. Whether
you are filing a bug report, or just asking for help, often you
should aim to provide a minimum working example to replicate the
issue. And as with all data exchanges, you should think about if
you can share the data and the source code in the way you intend
to before you do!</p>
<p>In learning to program, some things you might comprehend
instantly, other things might take several attempts. Some things
you might understand, but they seem strange. Usually, there is a
good reason why something works and is written the way it is, but
no language is perfect and the code to do something might be a
little odd and there could be a better way...</p>

<h2 id="4">4. Language Evolution, Deprecation and Versions</h2>
<p>High level computer programming languages like Python are
evolving and new ones occasionally get developed. Some programming
languages also become obsolete and some older versions of
languages become unsupported over time. Supporting
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_compatibility">
backward compatibility</a> - interoperability with older versions
- has both costs and benefits. These are weighed up seriously by
those developing languages, and breaking backward compatibility
is usually not done lightly. Language development is typically
attempted in a way to mitigate the costs whilst realising the
benefits.</p>
<p>Languages compete for users and developers. Often new features
in one language are implemented in others soon after, as there is
a demand and often a genuine need for them. The pace of language
evolution is related to the scale of investment in resources, and
the skill, and design decisions taken by the developer community.
</p>
<p>As new syntax, new functionality and more efficient ways of
doing things evolve in a language, some code either becomes
obsolete, or is best changed to use the new ways. This can require
considerable effort to retire or update code. Changes in the core
of a language often take place faster than in third party
libraries.</p>
<p>Fundamental changes in language syntax are associated with
major new versions of a language. Minor versions may add new
language features. Minor-minor version changes are usually
associated with bug fixes.</p>
<p>Deprecation is a common part of modern high level languages.
This is a process whereby certain ways of doing things are
gracefully phased out/retired. When no longer available, code that
relied on these deprecated ways will no longer work except with
older versions of source code language interpreters.</p>
<p>So, it is important to know what version of a language code has
been tested with. And it is useful to be aware that code written
in a language can start to look quite different over time.</p>

<h2 id="5">5. Considerata</h2>
<p>With any language, there are often several ways to achieve the
same or a similar thing. Some ways may work faster, can handle
larger volumes of data, or might be more concise in terms of the
amount of source code. There might be no obvious right way to do
something - so sometimes, independent programming efforts produce
significantly different source code. In other instances and
especially where there are style and naming guidelines, source
code produced independently may be identical.</p>
<p>In learning to program, and in programming generally, code
review is an important way to transfer skills and knowledge,
develop good practise and improve code and software.</p>
<p>Throughout this course, you are encouraged to produce easy to
understand, easy to maintain, efficient, reliable, well tested and
well documented code/software. Not all code/software in use today
is like this!</p>
<p>Just to re-iterate: Please take care and think about the
trustworthiness of any code you run and if in doubt, consult your
tutor.</p>
<p>Please read and adhere to the terms and conditions of software
licenses. Also keep in mind that for academic work, it is
important to keep track of what you consult and avoid plagiarism
(presenting other's work as your own).</p>
