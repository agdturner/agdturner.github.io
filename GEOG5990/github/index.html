<h1>GitHub</h1>
<h2 id="1">1. Introduction</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.github.com">GitHub</a> is a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git">Git</a>
based code hosting platform for version control and collaboration.
"It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere."
</p>
<p>GitHub makes it easy to get involved in code development, and
provides hosting for basic websites. It is popular and reliable.
</p>
<p>For a history of GitHub have a look at the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub">
GitHub Wikipeida Article</a></p>
<p>If you accept the
<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service">
GitHub Terms of Service</a>, please create a
<a href="http://www.github.com">GitHub</a> account choosing a
username comprising lower case letters and numbers. You do not
need a GitHub account to complete this course, but it is
recommended. There are other ways that you can use version control
and create a basic website for the assignments.</p>

<h2 id="2">2. Getting Started with GitHub</h2>
<p>Complete the
<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world">
Hello World Tutorial</a>.</p>
<p>If you are using a University of Leeds machine you can access
Git client software via AppsAnywhere and the Windows Vitual
Desktop:
<a href="https://wvd.leeds.ac.uk">https://wvd.leeds.ac.uk</a>.
Alternatively,
<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git#setting-up-git">
follow these instructions to setup a
<a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">Git Client<a> on your
local machine</a>.</p>
<p>Complete the
<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo">
GitHub Create a Repository Tutorial</a> and clone the repository
to the local machine you are using by following the
<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository">
GitHub Clone a Repository Tutorial</a>.</p>
<p>If you have followed correctly, you should now have a
hello-world local git repository cloned from a hello-world
remote repository on GitHub.</p>
<p>Now to practice making changes and keeping things synchronised:
First, make a change in the local hello-world repository, commit
the change, and then push the change to the remote repository on
GitHub:<p>
<ol>
<li>Open your local copy of README.md in a text editor, make a
change (for example, add a line of text) and save the file.</li>
<li>Open the git client command line interface and change to
the local repository directory.</li>
<li>Commit the change to the local repository and then push this
change to the remote repository on GitHub using the following
commands:
<pre>git add .
git commit -m "change this commit message so it is informative"
git push</pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>There are alternative ways to do this, but this way is
recommended.</p>
<p>Now, check on GitHub that the README.md file has changed. You
may need to reload the page in order to see the change.</p>
<p>Next, change the file on the remote GitHub repository using the
browser and commit the change there: To edit the README click on
the Edit Button which looks like a pen (in dark mode it looks
like the following where the button is identified with a red
elipse:
<img src="../resources/github/edit.png"  alt="GitHub README edit
button" />), then click on the "Commit changes" button which
should save the changes.</p>
<p>At this stage the remote repository is "ahead" of the local
repository which is "behind". To synchronize, we can pull the
committed remote repository change to the local repository: In the
git bash tool in the repository directory directory enter:</p>
<pre>git pull</pre>
<p>You should see confirmation of this pulling the remote
repository changes to the local repository.</p>
<p>There is a lot to learn with a versioning system and with
having multiple clones of repositories. Indeed there is a lot to
GitHub that we are not going to learn about and use in this
course. We are not going to learn about forking repositories,
creating branches, creating issues and resolving these by
submitting and accepting pull requests. These are all key steps in
collaborating on shared code bases in the GitHub ecosystem which
is typically what a lot of team programming involves nowadays.</p>
<p>Something you may have to learn about is to deal with merge
conflicts. This is when changes have been made to the same file
and in the same places such that the act of sychronizing the
repositories now requires decisions to be made about which
changes to keep. Let us deal with that in an ad hoc manner if and
when it happens.</p>
<p>One of the main benefits of using git or a similar repository
like system is that all changes are recorded and versioned,so it
is possible to reset to an earlier version should this be desired,
and this takes the difficulty away from doing this yourself.</p>

<h2 id="3">3. Python Code Repository Setup</h3>
<p>Create a new repository on GitHub which will be your code
repository for this course, call it something simple (you can
rename it later), include a README and in the '.gitignore' section
choose the python option. Spend some time to
<a href="https://choosealicense.com/">choose a license</a> and
select this from the options available. There are a few different
kinds. You are advised to choose an open source license and not
write your own from scratch. The license is a legal document that
states terms of use, modification and redistribution and provides
a disclaimer to indemnify you if something goes wrong.</p>
<p>Clone your new repository so you have a local repository set
up as was done with the hello-world repository. Create a new
folder/directory in the new repository called test.
Start Spyder; add a python command to the file that opens by
default and save this into your test directory. Add and Commit
changes to the local repository and push the changes to the remote
GitHub repository like you did with the hello-world repository.
Finally check the new file appears on GitHub.</p>
<p>Run the new Python file you have created. A directory named
__pycache__ might appear in the test directory with python source
code file. This contains interpreted files generated by the
python interpretter. The '.gitignore' settings for python will not
push this directory contents to GitHub - which is what we want.
</p>

<h2 id="4">4. GitHub Pages</h2>
<p>Create another repository on GitHub - your GitHub Pages
Website. Follow the
<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart">
GitHub Pages Quickstart Tutorial</a></p>

<h2 id="5">5. Taking Stock</h2>
<p>The benefits of using GitHub and the command line interface for
git might not yet be clear and this may seem a complicated
distraction, but it is important to be aware of current
programming practice and hopefully you will realise the benefits
during the course as you become more familiar with programming and
using git/GitHub.</p>
<p>There is a lot more to GitHub than has been covered here, but
having understood and practised creating repositories, cloning,
pulling, committing and pushing you are ready to return to
learning more about the python language and develop a repository
of python code.</p>
<p>If you have decided against using GitHub, then consider
using
<a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a>;
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/">Sourceforge</a>, or
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/">BitBucket</a> instead.</p>
<p>If you do not want to use these either, then consider using:
<a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a>,
<a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/">Mercurial</a> or
<a href="http://subversion.apache.org/">Subversion</a> to set up
a local repository.</p>
<p>As a minimum, please ensure your files are organised, versioned
and backed up.</p>
