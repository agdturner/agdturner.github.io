<h1>Agent Based Model Part 4</h1>
<h2 id="1">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Up to now, our agents are lists of two items - the coordinates
defining their location. More attributes could be added to the
list to represent other characteristics of the agents, but it is
almost certainly easier to define them a class for an agent and
use this instead.</p>

<h2 id="2">2. Define an Agent class</h2>
<p>In your local code repository src directory create a new
directory called "abm4". Open Spyder and use "save as" to save
your "model.py" file from abm3 into the abm4 directory.</p>
<p>Create a new file in the abm4 directory called
"agentframework.py", and add a minimal class definition for
an Agent class in it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class Agent():
    pass</code></pre>
<p>The keyword "pass" does not really do anything, but ensures
this code is syntactically correct. In the model.py file reduce
n_iterations to 10, and add the following import statement:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import agentframework</code></pre>
<p>At the start of the "# Initialise agents" code section add the
following lines:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">a = agentframework.Agent()
print("type(a)", type(a))</code></pre>
<p>Run model.py and examine the output which should contain the
following line:</p>
<pre>type(a) <class 'agentframework.Agent'></pre>
<p>So, we have successfully created an instance of the class Agent
as defined in the agentframework module.</p>
<p>Add a constructor method to the Agent class that initialises
x and y variable attributes of instances of the Agent class
to be random Integers between 0 and 99 as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import random

class Agent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.x = random.randint(0, 99)
        self.y = random.randint(0, 99)</code></pre>
<p>Note that for this to work, it was necessary to import the
random module.</p>
<p>In model.py, add a statement to print Agent a after it has
been instantiated and run the program again.</p>
<p>The new print statement should produce output that looks like
the following:</p>
<pre><agentframework.Agent object at 0x00000249AEA21D88></pre>
<p>The last part of your print statement will probably be
different and if you run the program again, it will likely be
different again. That last part is a memory address for where the
object is stored. Python does not control which address in memory
is used to store things, this is handled by the underlying
operating system, and what is allocated will depend on the system
state when the program is run.</p>
<p>When printing an Agent instance, it would be better if
something more informative were printed. The way yo do this is to
override the __str__ method in the Agent class. To do this, define
the method __str__() in the Agent class as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def __str__(self):
    return self.__class__.__name__ + "(x=" + str(self.x) \
        + ", y=" + str(self.y) + ")"</pre></code>
<p>Note that this has to be indented at the right level in the
Agent class. Also note that it returns a String which includes
the name of the class and details of the x and y variable
attributes which have been transformed by the built in function
str() to add them to the String that is returned. Run model.py
again and the print statement should now result in the following:
</p>
<pre>x=49, y=97</pre>
<p>Change the "# Initialise agents" code section to be:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Initialise agents
agents = []
for i in range(n_agents):
    # Create an agent
    agents.append(agentframework.Agent())
    print(agents[i])
print(agents)</code></pre>
<p>Run model.py and you should get similar output to the
following (in the error report, the file paths will probably be
different, and the line numbers might be different if your code
is not exactly the same):</p>
<pre>Check this is equal to 5: 5.0
Agent(x=49, y=97)
Agent(x=53, y=5)
Agent(x=33, y=65)
Agent(x=62, y=51)
Agent(x=38, y=61)
Agent(x=45, y=74)
Agent(x=27, y=64)
Agent(x=17, y=36)
Agent(x=17, y=96)
Agent(x=12, y=79)
[<agentframework.Agent object at 0x00000249B140C6C8>, <agentframework.Agent object at 0x00000249B14194C8>, <agentframework.Agent object at 0x00000249B1419148>, <agentframework.Agent object at 0x00000249B1419388>, <agentframework.Agent object at 0x00000249B14193C8>, <agentframework.Agent object at 0x00000249B1419448>, <agentframework.Agent object at 0x00000249B14191C8>, <agentframework.Agent object at 0x00000249B1419048>, <agentframework.Agent object at 0x00000249B1419488>, <agentframework.Agent object at 0x00000249B1419208>]
Traceback (most recent call last):

  File "\abm4\model.py", line 95, in <module>
    print("Maximum distance between all the agents", get_max_distance())

  File "\abm4\model.py", line 81, in get_max_distance
    distance = get_distance(a[0], a[1], b[0], b[1])

TypeError: 'Agent' object is not subscriptable</pre>
<p>So, the agents list is initialised, but when the list is
printed, it is as though the print function does not access the
__str__ method. The error is a consequence of the things stored in
the agents list no longer being lists, but instantiated Agent
objects.</p>
<p>To get the agents list to print out add the following method to
the Agent class:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def __repr__(self):
    return str(self)</code></pre>
<p>To overcome the error, it is necessary to refer to the
attributes of the Agent instances and not to the item in a no
longer existant list. So, change the following line of code in
the get_max_distance() function:</p>
<pre>distance = get_distance(a[0], a[1], b[0], b[1])</pre>
<p>To be:</p>
<pre>distance = get_distance(a.x, a.y, b.x, by)</pre>
<p>Notice that this is simpler and easier to read and understand.
</p>
<p>Now, everywhere else in the code that was referring to
a coordinate from the agents list - as being an item in a list -
also needs changing. Run the modified program to see the error and
where the next issue is encountered.</p>
<p>Occurrences of "agents[i][0]" should be changed to
"agents[i].x"; and, occurances of "agents[i][1]" should be change
to "agents[i].y". Make a further change in section of code for
plotting agents from:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Plot the coordinate with the largest x red
lx = max(agents, key=operator.itemgetter(0))
plt.scatter(lx[0], lx[1], color='red')
# Plot the coordinate with the smallest x blue
sx = min(agents, key=operator.itemgetter(0))
plt.scatter(sx[0], sx[1], color='blue')
# Plot the coordinate with the largest y yellow
ly = max(agents, key=operator.itemgetter(1))
plt.scatter(ly[0], ly[1], color='yellow')
# Plot the coordinate with the smallest y green
sy = min(agents, key=operator.itemgetter(1))
plt.scatter(sy[0], sy[1], color='green')</code></pre>
<p>To:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Plot the coordinate with the largest x red
lx = max(agents, key=operator.attrgetter('x'))
plt.scatter(lx.x, lx.y, color='red')
# Plot the coordinate with the smallest x blue
sx = min(agents, key=operator.attrgetter('x'))
plt.scatter(sx.x, sx.y, color='blue')
# Plot the coordinate with the largest y yellow
ly = max(agents, key=operator.attrgetter('y'))
plt.scatter(ly.x, ly.y, color='yellow')
# Plot the coordinate with the smallest y green
sy = min(agents, key=operator.attrgetter('y'))
plt.scatter(sy.x, sy.y, color='green')</code></pre>
<p>Compare the code to identify what has changed.</p>
<p>If you made all the changes as instructed, then the program
should now run without error and produce the same output as
previously.</p>
<p>As this completes a refactoring step, it is good practise to
commit this code to your repository with an approriate message.
So, do that now. It is not necessary to push this change to
GitHub yet, but remember to do so before the end of your coding
session (assuming you are using GitHub).</p>

<h2 id="3">3. Separation of Concerns</h2>
<p>Define a method called move in the Agent class as follows:</p>
<pre>def move(self, x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max):</pre>
<p>Cut the code from the "# Move agents" loop that moves an agent
and add it to the new move method, replacing all the "agents[i]"
with "self". Where the code was cut from, add the following to
call the move method:</p>
<pre>agents[i].move(x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max)</pre>
<p>Now, in the Agent class, it appears as though the move method
also takes in self, but this is not a parameter that is passed in.
Normally when calling a function the number of parameters matches,
but for methods (function in a class) things are slightly
different.</p>
<p>Running the program should produce the same results as
previously. The Agent class code now deals with the details of
how instances move, and the model.py code details when they do.
This is a reasonable separation of concerns for an Agent Based
Model.</p>

<h2 id="4">4. Give each agent a unique name</h2>
<p>It is possible that two Agent class instances might be located
at the same coordinates, and it would be helpful to distinguish
them further.</p>
<p>Add a docstring and a parameter to the constructor method of
Agent so that the method is as follows:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def __init__(self, i):
"""
The constructor method.

 Parameters
----------
i : Integer
    To be unique to each instance.

 Returns
-------
None.

"""
self.i = i
self.x = random.randint(0, 99)
self.y = random.randint(0, 99)
pass</code></pre>
<p>Run model.py and you should get the following error:</p>
<pre>Traceback (most recent call last):

  File "\abm4\model.py", line 91, in <module>
    agents.append(agentframework.Agent())

TypeError: __init__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'i'</pre>
<p>The error is that an expected argument is missing when
constructing an Agent instance. Change model.py to add the missing
argument "i". Modify the Agent class __str__ method to add the
unique characteristic of each Agent to the returned String.</p>
<p>Commit your code to your local repository and assuming you are
using GitHub - push your changes to GitHub.</p>
