<h1>GEOG5990 Programming for Geographical Information Analysis: Core Skills</h1>
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Welcome to the course website!</p>

<p>The course timetable is linked from the
<a href="https://webprod3.leeds.ac.uk/catalogue/dynmodules.asp?Y=202223&M=GEOG-5990M">University of Leeds GEOG5990 Module Catalogue Page</a>.</p>
<p>The website is a set of webpages and file based resources. At
the top of each webpage is a Style Button that can be used to
change between a lighter and darker style. Below that is a
Navigation Section which outlines the current page. Each webpage
links to the next at the end. Index and Reference webpages are
provided. Essentially, the idea is for you - students taking the
course - to read through the webpages trying out code yourself
and undertaking practical exercises. You may find it helpful to
re-read parts and re-do exercises.</p>
<p>If you encounter issues with the website, then please provide
feedback to get these sorted. If you are struggling to comprehend
parts, then please don't struggle for too long and ask for help.

</ul>
<p>Developing a computer program to do something typically
involves some problem solving and computational thinking. Often it
is helpful to break a task into smaller subtasks and to consider
if there is an order to these. Often a good solution involves
doing things repeatedly employing variables that may change with
each repetition. Often it is helpful to use a framework for
testing from the outset and to test often as the code develops.
</p>
<p>There is quite a lot of terminology for you to learn as well as
learning how things work. Some of the terminology is generic to
programming, some is more specific to Python.</p>
<p>There is a lot to learn especially if you are new to
programming.</p>

<h2 id="4">4. The Learning Journey</h2>
<p>Take time to develop your understanding and practise your new
programming skills.</p>
<p>Be experimental and remember to test your understanding by
testing code does what you expect it to. But, be cautious and
do not run code from a potentially untrustworthy source or
without comprehending fully what it does.</p>
<p>If some code does not do what you expected it to do, then treat
it as a learning experience. A key to coding is learning to be
able to interpret errors messages and understand what caused them.
Errors are not something to fear, but they are something not to
ignore!</p>
<p>In this website, the webpages with names starting "ABM" are a
series that gradually develop a basic spatial Agent Based Model.
This ABM can be regarded as a simplistic representation of animals
moving about in an environment, interacting with each other and
the environment. Developing the ABM by following instructions puts
into practise some of the theory detailed in the other webpages.
By the end of the instructions, you should have ABM model code
that: produces an animation; that can be operated from a basic
Graphical User Interface; reads in data from local files and from
the Web; and, outputs data files and messages for the user. You
should also at that stage be confident in how to go about
developing the model further without instructions. Whilst you
might like to spend time doing that. Your main challenge for this
module is to undertake an independent project - something done on
your own with perhaps additional guidance from your tutor. The
project will involve applying what you have learned to develop
some software or a program without detailed instructions.</p>


<h2 id="5">5. Platform/Software</h2>
<p>All the software used in this course is

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software">Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)</a> which is available to download and install on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">Linux</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows">Microsoft Windows</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS">macOS</a>.<p>
<p>The software is available to University of Leeds staff and
students via AppsAnywhere and the Academic Windows Virtual Desktop
which can be accessed via a Web browser and the following URL:
<a href="https://wvd.leeds.ac.uk">https://wvd.leeds.ac.uk</a>.
We will be making use of
<a href="https://www.anaconda.com/">Anaconda</a> - a data science
platform,
<a href="https://qgis.org/">QGIS</a> Desktop - Geographical
Information System software, and various third party Python
packages.</p>

<h2 id="6">6. Assignments and Assessments</h2>
<p>There are two assignments that are assessed:</p>
<ol>

<li>Assignment 1 Portfolio worth 20% of the overal mark and due 23rd March 2023 - developed by completing practical exercises by following instructions.</li>
<li>Assignment 1 Portfolio worth 20% of the overal mark and due 23rd March 2023 - developed by applying what you have learned to a task for which there are no detailed instructions. You should have sufficent knowledge to begin this assignment from about half way through the course.</li>
