<h1>GEOG5990 Programming for Geographical Information Analysis: Core Skills</h1>
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Welcome to the course website!</p>

<p>The course timetable is linked from the <a href="https://webprod3.leeds.ac.uk/catalogue/dynmodules.asp?Y=202223&M=GEOG-5990M">GEOG5990 Module Catalogue Page</a></p>
<p>The website is maintained by <a href="https://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/people/a.turner/index.html">Andy Turner</a> and comprises a set of webpages and file based resources.</p>
<p>At the top of each webpage is a button that can be actioned to
change between a lighter and darker page style. Below that is a
navigation section that links to each page. The pages are
sequential and at the end of each page, there is a link to the
next page.</p>
<p>There are index and references pages at the end. The index page
contains definitions for some terms and so is also a bit like a
glossary. As well, it links back to particular sections of other
pages that are relevant.</p>
<p>Essentially, the idea is that you - students taking the course
- read through the webpages trying out code and undertaking
practical exercises as directed.</p>
<p>Please contact your tutor by email or use the
<a href="https://minerva.leeds.ac.uk/">Minerva</a> Discussion
section if you want help, clarification or there is a problem with
these resources.</p>

</ul>
<p>Computer programming mostly involves computational thinking,
planning, problem solving and testing. It is often helpful to
break a task into smaller subtasks, and gradually develop an
implementation. Often good solutions to coding tasks involve doing
things repeatedly for a given sequence of things.</p>
<!--<p>Often it is
helpful to use a framework for testing from the outset and to test
often as the code develops.</p>-->
<p>If you are new to computer programming, there is quite a lot of
terminology to get used to, some is generic to programming, some
is more specific to Python.</p>
<p>There are some key concepts to understand which may take a few
attempts to understand, but hopefully you will realise that any
struggle was worth the effort!</p>

<h2 id="4">4. The Learning Journey</h2>
<p>Develop your understanding through practise and by reading.</p>
<p>Be experimental - test your understanding by testing code does
what you expect it to. If code does not do what you expect, try to
understand why - regard failure and errors as a learning
opportunity!</p>
<p>One of the keys to coding is learning to be able to interpret
errors messages and understand what caused them. If a program you
are developing unexpectedle raises an exception and reports an
error message, then try to understand why and stop this happening
before moving on. Ignoring an error message is nearly always the
wrong thing to do!</p>
<p>Be cautious and do not run code that you do not fully trust. If
in doubt consult with your tutor.</p>

<p>The webpages with names starting 'ABM' are a sequence of practicals that progress the development of a basic spatial <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent-based_model">Agent Based Model</a>. The ABM can be regarded as a simple model of autonomous spatial entities that move in an environment, interacting with the environment and each other.</p>
<p>Developing the ABM by following instructions puts into practise some of the theory detailed in other webpages. By the end of these practicals, you should have ABM model code that:</p>
<ul>
<li>has a basic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface">GUI</a>;</li>
<li>reads in data from local files and from the Web; and</li>
<li>produces an animation, data files and user friendly messages.
</li>
</ul>
<p>After completing the last ABM practical, you should have
sufficient knowledge and skill to develop the model in interesting
ways without being given detailed instructions.</p>
<p>To complete the course, you are to undertake an independent
project to apply what you have learned to develop some different
software - there will be a specification of what the code/software
is to do, some guidance for approaching the software development
task, but no detailed instructions to follow.</p>
<p>Do not expect to master the Python language by the end of this
course. Usually this takes many thousands of hours of practice
over many years.</p>
<p>Try to enjoy the learning journey, the challenges and the
rewards. Learning to program and learning Python is empowering!
</p>

<h2 id="5">5. Platform/Software</h2>
<p>All the software used in this course is

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software">Free and Open Source Software</a> (FOSS) - available to download and install on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">Linux</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows">Microsoft Windows</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/macOS">MacOS</a>.<p>
<p>The software is available via 'AppsAnywhere' at the University of Leeds which is accessible remotely via the 'Academic' <a href="https://wvd.leeds.ac.uk">University Windows Virtual Desktop</a>. The software includes: <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/">Anaconda</a> - a data science platform, <a href="https://qgis.org/">QGIS</a> Desktop - Geographical Information System software, and various third party Python packages.</p>
<h2 id="6">6. Assignments and Assessments</h2>
<p>There are two assignments that are assessed:</p>
<ol>

<li>Assignment 1 Portfolio worth 20% of the overall mark and due 23rd March 2023 - developed by completing the ABM practicals.</li>
<li>Assignment 2 Independent Project worth 80% of the overall mark and due 11th May 2023 - developed by applying what you have learned to a software development task for which there is a specification and suggestions of how to approach implementation, but no detailed instructions to follow. You should have sufficent knowledge and skill to begin this assignment after completing the ABM5 practical.</li>
<p>See the module page on <a href="https://minerva.leeds.ac.uk/">Minerva</a> for details of the assignments and how they are assessed.</p>
</ol>
<h2 id="6">6. About these learning resources</h2>
<p>These learning resources are based on
<a href="https://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/courses/computing/">
earlier versions of courses</a> developed originally by
<a href="https://ajevans.github.io/">
Andy Evans</a>.</p>
<p>Slightly updated version of the course were developed for
years, but a major refactor was completed in the academic year
2022-2023 to make the learning resources more accessible. This
refactoring involved implementing a
<a href="https://github.com/agdturner/agdturner.github.io">
new website build system</a>
which is based on
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)">
Java</a>.</p>
