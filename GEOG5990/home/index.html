<h1>GEOG5990 Programming for Geographical Information Analysis: Core Skills</h1>
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Welcome to the course website!</p>

<p>The course timetable is linked from the <a href="https://webprod3.leeds.ac.uk/catalogue/dynmodules.asp?Y=202223&M=GEOG-5990M">GEOG5990 Module Catalogue Page</a></p>
<p>These website is maintained by <a href="https://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/people/a.turner/index.html">Andy Turner</a> and comprises a set of webpages and file based resources.</p>
<p>At the top of each webpage is a Style Button that can be used to
change between a lighter and darker style. Below that is a
Navigation Section which outlines the current page. Each webpage
links to the next and at the end there is an index and a page of
references.</p>
<p>Essentially, the idea is that you - students taking the course
- read through the webpages trying out code and undertaking
practical exercises as directed.</p>
<p>Please contact your tutor by email or us the module Discussion
tool in
<a href="https://minerva.leeds.ac.uk/">Minerva</a> if you want
help or clarification or there is a problem with these resources.

<h2 id="3">3. Expectations</h2>

<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control">Version Control</a></li>
<li>Data encoding and data formats</li>
<li>Program input and output</li>
<!--

</ul>
<p>Computer programming mostly involves computational thinking,
planning, problem solving and testing. It is often helpful to
break a task into smaller subtasks, and to think about the order
in which to do things. Often good solutions involve doing a
sequence of things repeatedly on some data stored in a data
structure.</p>
<!--<p>Often it is
helpful to use a framework for testing from the outset and to test
often as the code develops.</p>-->
<p>If you are new to computer programming, there is quite a lot of
terminology to get used to, some is generic to programming, some
is more specific to Python.</p>
<p>There are some key concept to understand which may take several
attempts to learn fully.</p>

<h2 id="4">4. The Learning Journey</h2>
<p>Develop your understanding through practise and by reading.</p>
<p>Be experimental - test your understanding by testing code does
what you expect it to. If code does not do what you expect, try to
understand why - treat it as a learning opportunity.</p>
<p>One of the keys to coding is learning to be able to interpret
errors messages - understand what caused them. If your program
generates an exception and error message, then figure out what the
issue is and resolve before trying to implement code that does
something else. Ignoring errors is a bad idea. In general, the
more changes made to a program, the harder it becomes resolve an
issue.</p>
<p>Be cautious and do not run code that you do not fully trust.
Think about the code does that you want to try: Do you comprehend
it sufficiently to know it won't do anything malicious before
trying it out?</p>

<p>The webpages with names starting "ABM" are a sequence of practicals for the development of a basic spatial <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent-based_model">ABM</a>. The ABM can be regarded as a simple model of animals moving about in an environment, interacting with each other and the environment.</p>
<p>Developing the ABM by following instructions puts into practise much of the theory detailed in other webpages. By the end of these practicals, you should have ABM model code that:</p>
<ul>
<li>has a basic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface">GUI</a>;</li>
<li>reads in data from local files and from the Web; and</li>
<li>produces an animation, data files and user friendly messages.
</li>
</ul>
<p>At that stage, you should have sufficient knowledge and skill
to develop the model further without detailed instructions.</p>
<p>You are then to undertake an independent project to apply what
you have learned to develop some different software - there will
be a specification, some guidance for approaching the task, but no
detailed instructions to follow.</p>
<p>Do not expect to master the Python language by the end of this
course. It can take many years of experience to learn all about a
language. Try to enjoy the learning journey, the challenges and
the rewards.</p>
<p>Gaining elementry programming skills and knowledge is
empowering in a world where there skills are in high demand and
with which you can make a difference.</p>

<h2 id="5">5. Platform/Software</h2>
<p>All the software used in this course is

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software">Free and Open Source Software</a> (FOSS) which is available to download and install on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">Linux</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows">Microsoft Windows</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/macOS">MacOS</a>.<p>
<p>The software is available at the University of Leeds via 'AppsAnywhere' and the 'Academic' <a href="https://wvd.leeds.ac.uk">University Windows Virtual Desktop</a>. The software includes: <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/">Anaconda</a> - a data science platform, <a href="https://qgis.org/">QGIS</a> Desktop - Geographical Information System software, and various third party Python packages.</p>
<h2 id="6">6. Assignments and Assessments</h2>
<p>There are two assignments that are assessed:</p>
<ol>

<li>Assignment 1 Portfolio worth 20% of the overal mark and due 23rd March 2023 - developed by completing practical exercises by following instructions.</li>
<li>Assignment 2 Independent Project worth 80% of the overal mark and due 11th May 2023 - developed by applying what you have learned to a software development task for which there is a specification and a suggested way to approach implementation, but no detailed instructions to follow. You should have sufficent knowledge and skill to sensibly begin this assignment from about half way through the course.</li>
