<h1>GEOG5990 Programming for Geographical Information Analysis: Core Skills</h1>
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Welcome to the course website!</p>

<p>The course timetable is linked from the
<a href="https://webprod3.leeds.ac.uk/catalogue/dynmodules.asp?Y=202223&M=GEOG-5990M">University of Leeds GEOG5990 Module Catalogue Page</a>.</p>
<p>The website is a set of webpages and file based resources. At
the top of each webpage is a Style Button that can be used to
change between a lighter and darker style. Below that is a
Navigation Section which outlines the current page. Each webpage
links to the next at the end. Index and Reference webpages are
provided. Essentially, the idea is for you - students taking the
course - to read through the webpages trying out code yourself
and undertaking practical exercises. You may find it helpful to
re-read parts and re-do exercises.</p>
<p>If you encounter issues with the website, then please provide
feedback so that these can be resolved. If you are struggling to
comprehend things, then please don't struggle for long and ask
your tutor for help.

<h2 id="3">3. Expectations</h2>

<p>You will learn about:</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control">Version control</a></li>
<li>Encoding data</li>
<li>Data formats</li>
<li>Program input and output</li>
<!--
<li>Developing Python code (planning, writing, testing,
organising)</li>
<li>The Python parts of the
<a href="https://www.anaconda.com/">Anaconda</a> data science
platform</li>
<li>Processing geographical features (geometry and related

</ul>
<p>Computer programming typically involves problem solving and
computational thinking. It is often helpful to break a task into
smaller subtasks, and to think about the order in which to do
things. Often good solutions involve doing a sequence of things
repeatedly on some data stored in a data structure. Often it is
helpful to use a framework for testing from the outset and to test
often as the code develops.</p>
<p>There is quite a lot of terminology to learn, some is generic
to programming, some is more specific to Python.</p>
<p>There is a lot to learn especially if you are new to
programming.</p>

<h2 id="4">4. The Learning Journey</h2>
<p>Take time to develop your understanding and practise your new
programming skills.</p>
<p>Be experimental and test your understanding by testing code
does what you expect it to.</p>
<p>Be cautious and do not run code that you do not fully trust.
Think about the source of the code and whether you comprehend it
sufficiently to know it won't do anything malicious before trying
it out.</p>
<p>If code does not do what you expected it to, then treat it as
a learning opportunity and try to understand what is going on.</p>
<p>One of the keys to coding is learning to be able to interpret
errors messages and understand what caused them. Errors are not
something to fear, but they are something not to ignore!</p>
<p>The webpages with names starting "ABM" are sequence of
practicals that gradually develop a basic spatial Agent Based
Model (ABM). The ABM can be regarded as a simplistic
representation of animals moving about in an environment,
interacting with each other and the environment.</p>
<p>Developing the ABM by following instructions puts into practise
some of the theory detailed in other webpages. By the end of these
practicals, you should have ABM model code that:</p>
<ul>
<li>produces an animation, data files and messages;</li>
<li>reads in data from local files and from the Web; and</li>
<li>has a basic Graphical User Interface.</li>
</ul>
<p>You should then have sufficient knowledge and skill to develop
the model further without detailed instructions. Whilst you might
learn a lot trying to do that, save time for the main challenge in
this module, which is to undertake an independent project based on
a task set by your tutor. The task will involve applying what you
have learned to develop some software. There will be a
specification for the software, but no detailed instructions about
how to develop it.</p>

<h2 id="5">5. Platform/Software</h2>
<p>All the software used in this course is

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software">Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)</a> which is available to download and install on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">Linux</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows">Microsoft Windows</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS">macOS</a>.<p>
<p>The software is available at the University of Leeds via
AppsAnywhere and the Academic Windows Virtual Desktop which can be
accessed via a Web browser and the following URL:
<a href="https://wvd.leeds.ac.uk">https://wvd.leeds.ac.uk</a>.
This includes:
<a href="https://www.anaconda.com/">Anaconda</a> - a data science
platform,
<a href="https://qgis.org/">QGIS</a> Desktop - Geographical
Information System software, and various third party Python
packages.</p>

<h2 id="6">6. Assignments and Assessments</h2>
<p>There are two assignments that are assessed:</p>
<ol>

<li>Assignment 1 Portfolio worth 20% of the overal mark and due 23rd March 2023 - developed by completing practical exercises by following instructions.</li>
<li>Assignment 1 Portfolio worth 20% of the overal mark and due 23rd March 2023 - developed by applying what you have learned to a software development task for which there is a specification, but no detailed instructions to follow. You should have sufficent knowledge and skill to sensibly begin this assignment from about half way through the course.</li>
