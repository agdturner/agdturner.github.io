<h1>Agent Based Model Part 1</h1>
<h2 id="1">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>In a series of practicals you are aiming to develop a simple spatial <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent-based_model">Agent Based Model</a> (ABM). This type of model is useful for studying behaviour and emergence in complex systems.</p>
<p>The ABM will represent individual 'agents' which will have
varying characteristics. The model will run iteratively such that
each agent will do things in simulation steps (iterations of the
model) which represent the passage of time. What the agents do
will change their characteristics, possibly the characteristics
of other agents, and possibly the attributes of the spatial
environment in which the agents can move.</p>

<p>In building an ABM, you will put theory into practise and learn
about:</p>
<ul>
<li>testing and debugging;</li>
<li>using 'for loops' and conditional 'if statements';/li>
<li>defining functions and classes;</li>
<li>reading and writing data;</li>
<li>organising code into modules;</li>
<li>developing a simple GUI; and,</li>
<li>scraping and processing data from the Web.</li>
</ul>
<p>The agents will have simple behaviour and the model will be
very abstract. Nevertheless, hopefully, it will be clear how you
can develop it into something more realistic and useful.</p>
<p>The 'environment' will be initialised with data read from a
file. The 'model' simulation will be visualised as an animation.
Additional outputs from the model will be saved in files.</p>

<h2 id="2">2. Getting started</h2>
<p>Initially two agents are going to be represented in two
dimensional spatial locations given by cartesian coordinates:
(x0, y0) and (x1, y1). They will start at the same location and
move randomly one step. Some code will be written to calculate
the distance between the two agents. The way this is done by
following the instructions is imperfect. The code will be
refactored and rewritten in subsequent practicals so it is more
useful and makes use of more advanced ways that you will learn
more about in due course.</p>
<p>The algorithm for this practical that we are going to
implement can be written as follows:</p>
<pre># Initialise variable x0
# Initialise variable y0
# Change x0 and y0 randomly
# Initialise variable x1
# Initialise variable y1
# Change x1 and y1 randomly
# Calculate the Euclidean distance between (x0, y0) and (x1, y1)
</pre>
<p>In your local code repository create a new directory called
'src' and within this create a new directory called 'abm1'.</p>
<p>Open Spyder and save the file as 'model.py' in the 'abm1'
directory.</p>
<p>Copy the algorithm above and paste it into the file.</li>
<p>Add a line after the line "# Initialise a variable x0" to
initialise a variable 'x0' with the value '0' and print this
out:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">x0 = 0
print("x0", x0)</code></pre>
<p>Save and run the program. The output from running the program
should be:</p>
<pre>x0 0</pre>

<p>Note that two parameters are passed into the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print">print</a> function. These are printed out sequentially with a space delimiter by default.</p>
<p>Do the same for variable 'y0'.</p>
<h2 id="3">3. Randomly changing values</h2>
<p>The Python standard library <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html">random</a> module implements pseudo-random number generators for various distributions and provides a way to change variable  values randomly. To use the module it has to be imported. Towards the top of 'model.py' add the following import statement:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import random</code></pre>
<p>It is good practice to organise import statements at the top
of files as this makes them easy to find and reduces
inefficiencies of importing things multiple times.</p>

<p>An <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#if">if statement</a> is going to be used to increase or decrease 'x0' based on  the value obtained from a call to the function <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.random">random</a>. First obtain and print a pseudo-random number in the range [0, 1) as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">rn = random.random()
print(rn)</code></pre>

<p>Run your program a few times to observe that the value of 'rn' varies randomly.</p><p>What is happening, is that the start (seed) of pseudo-random sequence used to generate numbers randomly is being set from the computer clock time (which moves on incrementally at a high frequency.</p><p>If the value 'rn' is less that '0.5' increase 'x0' by '1', otherwise decrease 'x0' by '1':</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">if rn < 0.5:
    x0 = x0 + 1
else:
    x0 = x0 - 1</code>
print("x0", x0)</pre>

<p>Run your program a few times to observe that sometimes the
value of 'x0' increases and sometimes it decreases and this
corresponds to the value of 'rn'.</p>
<p>When testing code, it is usually undesireable to have different
results each time. So, it is better to 'set the seed' of random.
After the import statements add the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Set the pseudo-random seed for reproducibility
random.seed(0)</code></pre>
<p>When you run the program, you should get the following output:
</p>
<pre>x0 0
y0 0
rn 0.8444218515250481
b False
x0 - 1 </pre>
<p>For different results pass in a different value into the 'seed'
function (e.g. random.seed(1)).</p>
<p>Similarly modify the value of 'y0'. The similarly modify
'x1' and 'y1'.</p>

<h2 id="4">4. Calculate the Euclidean distance</h2>
<p>Use the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem">Pythogorean theorem</a> to calculate the distance between the cartesian coordinates (x0, y0) and (x1, y1). The algorithm is:</p>
<pre># Calculate the difference in the x coordinates.
# Calculate the difference in the y coordinates.
# Square the differences and add the squares
# Calculate the square root</pre>
<p>At the end of your source code set: 'x0' and 'y0' to equal '0';
'x1' to equal '3', and 'y1' to equal '4'. Then add the algorithm
above into your source code and try to calculate the distance
between the cartesian coordinates(0, 0) and (3, 4). The symbol
'**' can be used to raise a number to the power of another number.
So, raising a number to the power of '0.5' calculates the square
root.

(Alternatively, import the standard library <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html">math module</a> and use the <a href = "https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html#math.sqrt">sqrt</a> function). The expected distance between (0, 0) and(3, 4) is 5.</p>
<h2 id="5">5. Review, commit and look ahead</h2>
<p>If you managed to develop code that produces the correct
answer, then great. Do not worry if you did not get it working but
gave it a try.</p>
<p>There is a lot of repetition in the code. These agents only
move once each, but if we were to repeat the steps by duplicating
sections of code there would be even more code repetition.<p>
<p>Add and commit to your local git repository and assuming you
are using GitHub - push your changes to GitHub.</p>

<p>In the next ABM practical: Each pair of coordinates will be stored in a container, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#for">for loops</a> will be used to create and move more agents, and the model will be visualised.</p>
