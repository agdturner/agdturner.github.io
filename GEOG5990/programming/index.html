<h1>Programming</h1>
<h2 id="1">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming">Computer programming</a>
(coding) is about instructing computing machines (computers) to
carry out tasks where data is typically input, processed and
output.</p>
<p>Contemporary desktop and laptop computers typically have a
keyboard and mouse for user input, a visual display screen,
smaller amounts of faster more volatile data storage (memory), and
larger amounts of more persistent data storage (disk) that
is organised using a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system">file system</a>.
Computers may have inbuilt or perpherally connected devices such
as microphones and cameras, and the screen may be a touch screen.
Networked computers can typically communicate using standard
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet">Internet</a> protocols.
The basic functioning of a computer is handled by an 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system">operating system</a>
 upon which additional 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software">software</a>
 can be installed, including 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language">computer programming language</a>
interpretters and run time environments.</p>
<p>Programming can be done visually by arranging pre-built
components that fit or connect together to form workflows that
can be run. However, this course is not about visual programming,
it is about programming using text based command instructions
and specifically the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)">Python programming language</a> which like any written language has a formal syntax.</p>
<p>There are a wide variety of computer programming languages
each defined by a specific syntax. Some computer languages
look similar, some look very different. There are many common
syntactic components like keywords, delimiters, literals and
punctuation.</p>

<h2 id="2">2. Data</h2>
<p>In most modern computers, data is encoded in a binary form
where the smallest units called bits are in one of two possible
states. Many encodings equate these to the numbers one (1) and
zero (0).</p>
<p>Typically computers work with fixed size collections of bits
called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte">bytes</a>.
The more bits there are in a byte, the more different unique
combinations or arrangements of bits there are. With each added
bit, there is a power of two more combinations. So, with 2
bits there are 4 possible combinations (00, 01, 10, 11); with 3
bits there are 8 combinations (000, 001, 010, 100, 011, 101, 110,
111); with 4, 16; with 7, 128; with 8, 256. This exponential
doubling pattern continues so that with just 64 bits there are
18446744073709551616 combinations.</p>
<p>7 bits in a byte allows for all English/Roman alphabet letters
in both lower and upper case, the ten numeric digits 0 to 9, and
64 other symbols to be uniquely represented (encoded as a series
of bits of a fixed length). The
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII">ASCII</a>
format is a text encoding using 7 bits. ASCII is used to encode
file paths on some operating systems and is used for a lot of
simple text file encodings. It gets expensive to store numbers
with a large number of digits in ASCII, and other encodings are
needed to represent more characters.</p>
<p>Some data formats encode different parts of a file using
different byte lengths and with reference to different encodings.
The encodings are mappings that define what each series of bits
represents. The encodings can become complicated as what a thing
is to represent can be part encoded in the data rather than in
some standard look up (a map that links unique keys to, in this
case, unique values).</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode">Unicode</a> is
a common standard encoding used for a lot communication data.
As of Unicode version 15.0, there are 149,186 characters,
including mathematical symbols and emojis with attributed codes.
It uses between 1 and 4 bytes of length 8 for encoding.
</p>
<p>Commonly, there are multiples of 8 bits in a byte.</p>
<p>Data formats have a specification which details how data are
encoded. Some are open formats, where details of the specification
are made publicly available and changes to the format are made by
standards defining organisations. Formats can change over time and
so are typically versioned.</p>
<p>Individual integer numbers in a range are typically represented
using a fixed number of bits that can map individually to every
number in the range. The encoding will detail how this is done and
what the range is. Often, zero is either the middle or at the
start of the range. The type of such integer number
representations are the details of the range and encoding. To
represent integer numbers beyond this range, either the number of
bits for all numbers must increase, or multiple bytes must be
combined into a single number, so for this an additional byte
might be needed to encode the number of bytes. Python hides the
encoding complications and from the outside appears to have just
one type of integer. How this is done is implementation specific
in that different interpreters may handle this differently.</p>
<p>Non-integer encodings include numbers commonly called floating
point numbers that are currently commonly encoded using a 32 and
64 bits. With these, a subset of rational numbers (fractions) are
encoded the density of these varies throughout a range. In general
the density is greatest in the middle of the range and more sparse
towards the extremes of the range. In
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic">
floating point arithmetic</a>, the result of a
calculation is rounded to the nearest value in the range.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-precision_floating-point_format">
Single precision floating point format</a> uses 32 bits per
number.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format">
Double precision floating point format</a> uses 64 bits per
number. The important things to bear in mind about these
numbers is that calculations with them are only sometimes
accurate, and the imprecision varies. This can be a source of
significant confusion and error especially when using these
numbers for geometry, physics and statistics.</p>
<p>Computers do not have a way to precisely represent
transcendental numbers except symbolically. So, for example, the
ratio of the circumference to the diameter of a circle can be
represented by a symbol, but only stored approximately in a
computer (although that approximation might be accurate to as many
decimal places as have been calculated - so long as that
information is available and there is sufficent memory).</p>

<h2 id="3">3. Learning to Program</h2>
<p>Learning to program takes time and energy. It involves
developing and strengthening neural networks in your brain. So,
try to find time to learn new programming concepts when you are
well rested and most able. You can apply things you already know
when you are more tired, but try not to program when you are tired
as this is when it is easy to make mistakes and do worse than
wasting your time!</p>
<p>People have different backgrounds and experiences, and learn
better at different times. Part of learning to program is about
learning to program yourself!</p>
<p>Organise to take breaks as you are learning to program. Breaks
help you avoid fatigue, remember what you are learning, and enjoy
the learning experience. Often if you think about something else
for a short while and then return to think about something that
was not making sense, then suddenly you find it making sense.</p>
<p>It is not reasonable to expect to learn everything about a
programming language like Python in an introductory course. You
will learn about most of the supported syntax, but the
functionality is vast and knowing all about what there is and when
to use it typically takes more time than you have for this course.
It is more important to learn how to discover functionality that
does what you want than to know about all there is. Mastering a
language can take many years of study and practise.</p>
<p>Once familiar with one programming language, it is usually
much easier to learn others. Many languages can be used to do the
same things, but some are particularly suited to specific tasks.
</p>
<p>Programming and programming language development are typically
community activities. It is normal to ask others for help and to
provide others with help and work collaboratively to develop
things. There are many different types of forums that can be used
for this. Feel free to engage in online forums if you want, but
please do not post questions about this course and turn instead to
your tutor for help.</p>
<p>If you want help, then please ask. Your tutor is here to help
and has lots of experience, so please ask for help rather than
staying stuck for too long.</p>
<p>There is a skill to asking for programming help. You might want
to show someone what is happening and talk about it as often
something explained in a slightly different way helps.</p>
<p>Often it is a good idea to document an issue - write down
what happens and why this is different to what you expect. Often
the act of documenting the issue helps you to understand better
and you might simply want to ask to confirm your understanding.
If you detail the steps required to replicate the issue and
explain what is happening and why this is different to what you
expect, then it is easy to ask for help and for the helper to
provide the help. Typically this involves providing a copy of
your code and any input data.</p>
<p>Some things you might comprehend instantly, other things might
take several attempts. Some things you might understand, but it
seems strange. Usually, there is a good reason why something works
and is written the way it is, but no language is perfect! They
evolve - often in strange seeming ways - or they die!</p>

<h2 id="4">4. Language Evolution, Deprecation and Versions</h2>
<p>Most computer programming languages are evolving and new ones
occasionally emerge. Some programming languages become obsolete
and some versions become unsupported over time. Supporting
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_compatibility">
backward compatibility</a> - interoperability with older versions
- has both costs and benefits. These are weighed up seriously by
those developing languages, and breaking backward compatibility
is not done lightly. Language development is attempted in a way to
mitigate the costs whilst realising the benefits.
</p>
<p>Languages compete for users and developers. Often new features
in one language are implemented in others soon after. The pace of
language evolution is related to the scale of investment in
resources and the skill and design decisions of the developers.
</p>
<p>Languages evolve and many general purpose languages are
becoming more similar. It is hard to be aware of all the new
language features in a fast evolving language like Python. It is
also hard to keep track of changes in the ecosystem of third party
libraries that extend and enrich it.</p>
<p>As languages evolve, often new functionality is added and new
types of expression (new syntax) are supported. These changes are
driven by what users want and what is available in other
languages. Fundamental changes in language syntax are associated
with major new versions of a language.</p>
<p>Deprecation is a common part of modern high level languages.
This is a process whereby certain ways of doing things are
gracefully phased out. When no longer available, code that relied
on deprecated ways will only work with older versions of the
language.</p>
<p>So, it is important to know what version of a language code has
been tested with. And it is useful to be aware that code written
in a language can start to look quite different over time.
</p>

<h2 id="5">5. Considerata</h2>
<p>Programatically, with any given language, there are often
several different ways to achieve the same or a similar thing.
Sometimes independent programming efforts produce (almost)
identical code, but this is rare.</p>
<p>In learning to program, and in programming generally, code
review is an important way to transfer skills and knowledge,
develop good practise and improve code and software.</p>
<p>Throughout this course, you are encouraged to produce easy to
understand, easy to maintain, efficient, reliable, well tested and
well documented code/software. Not all code/software in use today
is like this!</p>
<p>Just to re-iterate: Please take care and think about the
trustworthiness of any code you run and if in doubt, consult your
tutor.</p>
<p>Please read and adhere to the terms and conditions of software
licenses. Also keep in mind that for academic work, it is
important to keep track of what you consult and avoid plagiarism
(presenting other's work as your own).</p>
