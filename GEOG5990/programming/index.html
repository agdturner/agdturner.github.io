<h1>Programming</h1>
<h2 id="1">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming">Computer programming</a>
(coding) is about instructing computing machines (computers) to
carry out tasks where data is typically input, processed and
output.</p>
<p>Contemporary desktop and laptop computers typically have a
keyboard and mouse for user input, a visual display screen,
smaller amounts of faster more volatile data storage (memory), and
larger amounts of more persistent data storage (disk) that
is organised using a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system">file system</a>.
Computers may have inbuilt or perpherally connected devices such
as microphones and cameras, and the screen may be a touch screen.
Networked computers can typically communicate using standard
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet">Internet</a> protocols.
The basic functioning of a computer is handled by an 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system">operating system</a>
 upon which additional 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software">software</a>
 can be installed, including 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language">computer programming language</a>
interpretters and run time environments.</p>
<p>Programming can be done visually by arranging pre-built
components that fit or connect together to form workflows that
can be run. However, this course is not about visual programming,
it is about programming using text based command instructions
and specifically the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)">Python programming language</a> which like any written language has a formal syntax.</p>
<p>There are a wide variety of computer programming languages
each defined by a specific syntax. Some computer languages
look similar, some look very different. There are many common
syntactic components like keywords, delimiters, literals and
punctuation.</p>

<h2 id="2">2. Data</h2>
<p>In most modern computers, data is encoded in a binary form
where the smallest units called bits are in one of two possible
states. Many encodings equate these to the numbers one (1) and
zero (0).</p>
<p>Typically computers work with fixed size collections of bits
called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte">bytes</a>.
The more bits there are in a byte, the more different unique
combinations or arrangements of bits there are. With each added
bit, there is a power of two more combinations. So, with 2
bits there are 4 possible combinations (00, 01, 10, 11); with 3
bits there are 8 combinations (000, 001, 010, 100, 011, 101, 110,
111); with 4, 16; with 7, 128; with 8, 256. This exponential
doubling pattern continues so that with just 64 bits there are
18446744073709551616 combinations.</p>
<p>7 bits in a byte allows for all English letters in both lower
and upper case, the ten numeric digits 0 to 9, and 64 other
symbols to be uniquely represented. This was the limit of the
original <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII">ASCII</a>
format, and is still a restriction for file paths on many
operating systems.</p>
<p>A lot of modern data is now encoded using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode">Unicode</a>.
As of Unicode version 15.0, there are 149,186 characters,
including mathematical symbols and emojis with attributed codes.
</p>
<p>Commonly there are multiples of 8 bits in a byte. Individual
numbers are often represented using 32 or 64 bits. For integer
number representations, typically all interger values in a range
are represented in the byte encoding. For non-integer only
encodings commonly known as floating point numbers, a subset of
rational numbers are also encoded and the range of integers can be
larger, but the integers within this range that are representable
is more sparse. In
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic">
standard floating point arithmetic</a>, the result of a
calculation is rounded to the nearest value.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-precision_floating-point_format">
Single precision floating point format</a> uses 32 bits per
number.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format">
Double precision floating point format</a> uses 64 bits per
number. The important thing to bear in mind about these
numbers is that calculations with them are only sometimes
accurate, and the imprecision varies. This can be a source of
significant confusion and error especially when using these
numbers for geometry and statistics.</p>

<h2 id="3">3. Learning to Program</h2>
<p>Others on your course may seemingly be learning faster than
you. Please do not worry about this and take time to develop your
understanding. Try to take regular and frequent breaks to look
after yourself, avoid fatigue and help you remember and enjoy the
learning experience.</p>
<p>People learn in different ways and some get lucky and
comprehend some things a bit quicker than others. Initially,
anyone with more programming experience is likely to progress
faster than anyone with less, but after learning the basics in an
introductory course, skill and knowledge levels tend to become
more similar.</p>
<p>Most computer programming languages are evolving and new ones
occasionally emerge. Some programming languages become obsolete
and some versions become unsupported over time. Supporting
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_compatibility">
backward compatibility</a> - interoperability with older versions
- has both costs and benefits. These are weighed up seriously by
those developing a language, and breaking backward compatibility
is not done lightly and in Python and in other widely used
languages it is attempted in a way to mitigate the costs whilst
realising the benefits.
</p>
<p>It is not reasonable to expect to learn everything about all
languages. Some languages are so expansive that even learning all
the supported syntax and when it is appropriate to use it can take
many years of study and practise.</p>
<p>Languages compete for users and developers. Often new features
in one langauge will be implemented in others not very long in the
future. The pace at which languages are evolving is related to the
amount of investment in resources and the skill and design
decisions of the developers.</p>
<p>Some programming concepts may be difficult to understand,
especially if you try and expect to learn these in one attempt and
or when you are not well rested. It can be frustrating to not make
progress. This is more likely to happen if you work too hard than
if you work too little.</p>
<p>Your tutor is here to help and has lots of experience, so
please ask for help rather than staying stuck for too long. Often
something explained in a slightly different way, just talking
about something, or writing something down to try to explain what
you don't understand can lead to a better understanding that helps
you to make progress much faster.</p>
<p>Some things you might comprehend instantly, other things might
take several attempts. Some things you might understand, but it
seems strange. Many things it is best to simply understand what
they do and not how they work. Usually, there is a good reason why
something works and is written the way it is, but no language is
perfect!</p>
<p>Once familiar with one programming language, it is usually
much easier to learn others. Many languages can be used to do the
same things, but some are particularly suited to specific tasks.
</p>
<p>Languages evolve and are in some ways becoming more
syntactically similar. As well as it being hard to keep track of
all the new langauge features in the core of a high level
language like Python, it is also hard to keep track of changes in
the ecosystem of third party libraried that extend and enrich
it.</p>
<p>Programming and programming language development are typically
community activities. It is normal to ask others for help and to
provide others with help and work collaboratively to develop
things. There are many different types of forums that can be used
for this. Feel free to read the questions and answers posts on
other forums if you want, but please do not post questions about
this course and turn instead to your tutor for help.</p>
<p>If you want help, then make it easy for your tutor to help you
and in the future for others to help you. Sometimes the act of
documenting an issue and asking for help gets you to understand
and resolve the issue before sedning the help request. Once you
get into coding, if something is not working as you expect, and
you want to ask for help, then bear in mind that it is often
easiest to detail the minimal steps required to replicate the
issue. Typically this involves providing a copy of your code and
any input data as well as details of what the issue is. A key
skill in programming is learning how to ask for help.</p>

<h2 id="4">4. Language Evolution, Deprecation and Versions</h2>
<p>As languages evolve, often new functionality is added and new
types of expression (new syntax) are supported. These changes are
driven by what users want and what is available in other
languages. Fundamental changes in language syntax are associated
with major new versions of a language.</p>
<p>Deprecation is a common part of modern high level languages.
This is a process whereby certain ways of doing things are
gracefully phased out. When no longer available, code that relied
on deprecated ways will only work with older versions of the
language.</p>
<p>So, it is important to know what version of a language code has
been tested with. And it is useful to be aware that code written
in a language can start to look quite different over time.
</p>

<h2 id="5">5. Considerata</h2>
<p>Programatically, with any given language, there are often
several different ways to achieve the same or a similar thing.
Sometimes independent programming efforts produce (almost)
identical code, but this is rare.</p>
<p>In learning to program, and in programming generally, code
review is an important way to transfer skills and knowledge,
develop good practise and improve code and software.</p>
<p>Throughout this course, you are encouraged to produce easy to
understand, easy to maintain, efficient, reliable, well tested and
well documented code/software. Not all code/software in use today
is like this!</p>
<p>Just to re-iterate: Please take care and think about the
trustworthiness of any code you run and if in doubt, consult your
tutor.</p>
<p>Please read and adhere to the terms and conditions of software
licenses. Also keep in mind that for academic work, it is
important to keep track of what you consult and avoid plagiarism
(presenting other's work as your own).</p>
