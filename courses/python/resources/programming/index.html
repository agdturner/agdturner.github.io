<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming,_also_known_as">Computer programming, also known as</a> coding, is about instructing a computer to carry out a set of tasks. Typically this involves data that are input, processed and output. Outputs may also be visual displays and sounds, and a computer can be used to control other things like motors and sensors.</p>
<p>Different computers have different input and output devices. Current desktop and laptop machines typically have a keyboard and a mouse for user input and a visual display screen. The may also have microphones and cameras, and the screen may be a touch screen..</p>
<p>These computers typically have smaller amounts of faster more volitile data storage (memory), and larger amounts of more persistent data storage known as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system">file system</a>.  They are typically connected to a networked either via a cable, or via a wireless communication module. This allows for communication with other computers on either just a local network, or on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet">Internet</a>. The basic functioning of computer is managed by an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system">operating system</a> that is loaded onto the machine and configured to run when it is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booting">booted</a>. Additional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software">software</a> can be added and run on the operating system to extend the machines capability. This includes things like interpretters or virtual machines which allow users to run programs written in specific <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language">computer programming language</a>s.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_programming">Visual programming</a> involves Workflows that are like programs can often be developed by arranging and connecting components in a graphical display. This is called visual programmingcourse is not about visual programming, it is about programming using text based command instructions written in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)">Python</a>.</p>
<p>There are a wide variety of computer programming languages each defined by a specific syntax (rules). Like natural languages, computer languages can look similar and very different. Whilst these learning resources focus on Python, occasionally similarities and differences between Python and other languages are explained.</p>
<h2>Data</h2>
<p>The smallest amount of binary data is called a bit. It is a unit that is in one of two possible states. Perhaps it is easiest to think of these states as being positive or negative, true or false, or one (1) or zero (0). Let's use 0 or 1 for now.</p>
<p>Typically computers work with fixed size collections of bits called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte">bytes</a>. The more more bits in a byte, the more different unique combinations or arrangements of bits in the byte there are. With each added bit there is a power of two more combinations. With 2 bits there are 4 possible combinations (00, 01, 10, 11). With 3 bits there are 8 combinations (000, 001, 010, 100, 011, 101, 110, 111). With 4, 16... With 8, 256...</p>
<p>Many encodings use 8 bits in a byte (as this allows for all English letters in both lower and upper case, the ten numeric digits 0 to 9, and 192 mathematical and other symbols to be uniquely represented. To represent individual numbers, computers typically use more bits depending on the type of number. We will come back to numerical representations and calculations later.</p>
<h2>Learning to Program</h2>
<p>If you are new to computer programming, then you will be learning lots of new terms and concepts as well as learning the syntax of Python in this course. This can be very tiring, and it can take a while for some things to be fully understood. You are strongly encouraged to take breaks for your own well being and also because this will often help you learn faster.</p>
<p>Learning to program requires practice and typically involves making lots of mistakes - not bad mistakes, good mistakes - ones which you can learn from. In some ways learning to program is a bit like learning to write, or learn to play a musical instrument. It is best to mix up a bit of theory and a bit of practise and not to leave it too long between learning sessions.</p>
<p>There is typically more to learn with the first computer programming language you learn. Once you can program well in one language, it is generally much easier to learn another language. Once you know two languages well, you might turn to one to do some things and another to do other things. Or, you might prefer a particular language for a time.</p>
<p>High level languages are typically evolving to be more  efficient and capable. Often this involves syntactic changes such that old code can look quite different and there can be several ways to do the same thing.</p>
<p>In general, programmers should aim to produce easy to understand, easy to maintain, efficient, reliable, well-tested and well documented code.</p>
<h2>Code Structure</h2>
<p>Programming languages provide for different levels of organisation. Code in a single file might be referred to as a script. It gets cumbersome working with everything in one file, so typically code is separated into multiple files and into reusable parts called functions that may be organised in a hierarchy of classes. If you are writing code to provide a way for others to do things, really, you are developing software and there becomes a need to think about supporting users that may want to use the software without knowing anything about the underlying programming language the software is based on.</p>
<h2>Software and Programming Language Development</h2>
<p>A lot of software is developed by teams of professionals. Code is often reviewed and team members specialise and work together collaboratively. Some team members are more like software testers and user interface designers. It can be helpful for all these team members to have some basic knowledge of computer programming. It is also helpful for software users to understand a bit about computer programming to help them report issues they encounter when using software so that these are more likely to be addressed and fixed over time.</p>
<h2>Asking for help</h2>
<p>Software and programming language development are typically community activities. It is normal to ask others for help and to provide others with help and work collaboratively to develop things. There are different types of forums for asking and anwering questions and different types of project that you might want to get involved with once you have gained some experience. If you are supported by a tutor at university, you are discouraged from posting to forums to ask for help unless you are directed to do this by your tutor. If you have a tutor, please ask your tutor for help if you get stuck. If you ask for help by email, it is often a good idea to attach your code, explain what you think should happen and describe what happens instead. Often your tutor will see the problem right away, but they may want to test things to be sure, so try to make it easy for them to help you.</p>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming">Computer programming</a>
(coding) is about instructing computing machines (computers) to
carry out tasks where data is typically input, processed and
output. Computers are typically networked through connections
to other devices.</p>
<p>Desktop and laptop computers typically have a keyboard and
mouse for user input, a visual display screen, smaller amounts
of faster more volatile data storage (memory), and larger amounts
of more persistent data storage (disk) that uses a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system">file system</a>.
Computers may have inbuilt or perpherally connected microphones
and cameras, and the screen may be a touch screen. Networked
computers can typically communicate with other machines on the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet">Internet</a>.
The basic functioning of the computer is handled by an 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system">operating system</a>
 that is configured to run when 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booting">booted</a>.
Additional 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software">software</a>
can be added and run on the operating system to extend the
capability of the computer. This includes
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language">computer programming language</a>
interpretters and run time environments which allow programs
to be compiled and run.</p>
<p>Programming can be done visually by arranging pre-built
components that fit or connect together to form workflows that
can be run. However, this course is not about visual programming,
it is about programming using text based command instructions
written specifically in the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)">Python programming language</a>.</p>
<p>There are a wide variety of computer programming languages
each defined by a specific syntax. Some computer languages
look similar, some look very different. Whilst these learning
resources focus on Python, occasionally similarities and
differences between Python and other languages are pointed out.
</p>
<h2>2. Data</h2>
<p>In most modern computers, data is encoded in a binary form
where the smallest unit is called a bit which is in one of two
possible states. Let us lable these one (1) and zero (0).</p>
<p>Typically computers work with fixed size collections of bits
called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte">bytes</a>.
The more more bits in a byte, the more different unique
combinations or arrangements of bits in the byte there are. With
each added bit, there is a power of two more combinations. With 2
bits there are 4 possible combinations (00, 01, 10, 11). With 3
bits there are 8 combinations (000, 001, 010, 100, 011, 101, 110,
111). With 4, 16... With 7, 128. With 8, 256...</p>
<p>Encodings use different numbers of bits in a byte depending on
the variety of things that are to be expressed. The order of the
bits in the byte is known as the endian (big-endian, or little
endian). 7 bits in a byte allows for all English letters in both
lower and upper case, the ten numeric digits 0 to 9, and with
capacity for 64 other symbols to be uniquely represented. Often
file paths are encoded in 7 bit representations. More commonly
there are 8 bits in a byte. To represent individual numbers,
often 32 or multiples of 2 thereof bits are used depending on the
type of number. Numerical representations of non-integer numbers
including is often
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-precision_floating-point_format">
single precision floating point format</a>
or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format">
double precision floating point format</a>. Essentially, these
provide an extended range over a fixed-point (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_magnitude">order of magnitude</a>)
format at the cost of precision. We will revisit numerical
representation and precision in more detail later in the course...</p>

<h2>3. Learning to Program</h2>
<p>If you are new to computer programming, then you will learn
lots of new terms and concepts as you learn the basics of Python
in this course. There is a lot to learn, which can be tiring! You
are strongly encouraged to take breaks to help understand these
new things. Typically you will learn faster, remember easier,
avoid fatigue and enjoy the learning experience more if you take
regular breaks.</p>
<p>It is perfectly normal for it to take several attempts to learn
some concepts, even if you are well rested and in the right frame
of mind to learn. This can be frustrating especially if you think
others are learning things faster. Try not to worry about how fast
anyone else is learning, it is not a race and there are likely to
be technical hiccups along the way that might slow anyone down.
</p>
<p>Once you can program well in one language, it is generally much
easier to learn to program using another language. Once you know
two languages well, you might use one to do some things and
another to do other things, and you might be more confident to try
another language.</p>
<p>Programming and programming language development are typically
community activities. It is normal to ask others for help and to
provide others with help and work collaboratively to develop
things. There are different types of forums for asking, answering
and feeding back available. Whilst you are encouraged to use these
to read things and perhaps feedback. If you are enrolled on a
course, please first ask your tutor for help before posting. If
asking your tutor for help by email, it is often a good idea to
attach your code, explain what you think should happen and
describe what happens instead.</p>

<h2>4. Considerata</h2>
<p>High level languages evolve. New functionality is added and
syntax can change to allow for more compact or easier to
understand expressions. This can mean that code written in an
older version of a language might appear different. In some
language evolution, old versions of the syntax are broken and
it is no longer guaranteed that code will run as expected and so
needs reviewing and testing again and potentially refactoring
(reworking) so that it will work again. It is important to be
aware of this when learning to program. Everything that you do and
use needs to be reviewed and tested.</p>
<p>Sometimes language evolution results in syntactic changes such
that code written in older syntax will not necessarily work in
newer interpretters. (Interpretters convert the source code into
lower level machine instructions.)</p>
<p>With any given syntax, there are usually a plethora of
different ways to achieve the same or a similar thing. Some ways
might be computationally faster under all or particular
circumstances, some might be more memory efficient, some may work
on a more diverse range of inputs, and in a range of cases all
these different ways might result in the same results or
behaviours. In other cases, some ways might be more precise or
accurate or result in different behaviours. For some programming
tasks, implementation detail are likley to vary a lot, for others
only subtle differences are likely.</p>
<p>In learning to program, and in programming generally, code
review is an important way to transfer skills and knowledge, and
to develop good practises and improve code bases.</p>
<p>In general you are encouraged to produce easy to understand,
easy to maintain, efficient, reliable, well tested and well
documented code. Only a fraction of the code used today is like
this!</p>
<p>Please also bear in mind that not all code is used to make the
world a better place. Take care to think about the trustworthiness
of anything you run and if approriate, review code before you run
it.</p>
<p>Please adhere to the terms and conditions of software licenses.
Also bear in mind that for academic work, it is important to keep
track of what is used so as not to plagiarise (present other's
work as our own).</p>
