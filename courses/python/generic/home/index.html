<h1>Programming for Geography: Python 1</h1>
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Welcome!</p>
<<<<<<< HEAD
<p>If in 'Dark Mode', the 'Style Button' at the top of the page contains the text "Light Mode" and the page background colour is dark and text is lighter. If in 'Light Mode', the Style Button contains the text "Dark Mode" and the page background colour is light and text is darker. You can action the Style Button to change between these modes. The style setting is used for each page in the site. In Dark Mode links to external sites are styled with a dark red background. The site is designed to be accessible. If you have difficulty in using the site, please report issues via the <a href="https://www.github.com/agdturner/agdturner.github.io">agdturner.github.io GitHub Repository</a>.</p>
<p>The course Web pages are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources">Open Educational Resources</a> developed by <a href="https://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/people/a.turner/index.html">Andy Turner</a> and used for teaching at <a href="https://www.leeds.ac.uk">The University of Leeds</a>. The pages support learning the basics of computer programming in general and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)">Python programming language</a> (Python) in particular.</p>
<p>In the header of each page is a navigation section which links to the other pages. The navigation section is essentially the same for all the web pages. The link for the currently loaded page has a thin green outline. After the navigation section is a level 1 heading containing the title of the page.</p>
<p>At the bottom of each page there is a footer section which links to the next page (until the last page - a page of references). The page before last is an index page which links back to sections of pages a bit like the index of a text book.</p>
<p>Please go through the pages in order pausing to think, explore links, take breaks, perhaps talk with peers, and undertake practical exercises as directed. It may help you to repeat read some sections or pages before moving on.</p>
<p>There are many links to other websites in these pages, including Wikipedia articles about programming concepts and Python documentation. Don't worry, you don't need to fully understand things before moving on. Try not to get lost in too much detail as you read.</p>
<p>Reading programming language documentation can be a very good way to learn about any language, especially if you are familiar with other programming languages. The style and layout of the documentation for any particular language may take a bit of getting used to, but it is worth getting familiar with this as you practise.</p>
<p>Learning new things is tiring and can be very difficult or impossible to do if you are tired. Try to keep this in mind and manage your time to make good use of your special learning abilities when you have them. Take breaks, look after yourself and try to enjoy the learning journey.</p>

<h2>The Learning Journey</h2>
<p>Learning to program involves practical problem solving and computational thinking (such as breaking a problem into a set of smaller tasks). The main workflow is to: plan, write, test, and review.</p>
<p>You are encouraged to be experimental and take your time to develop your understanding and practise your skills. There is a lot to learn especially if you are new to programming.</li>
<p>Following instructions, you are encouraged to develop a simple Agent Based Model (ABM) that represents animals moving about in an environment, interacting with each other and the environment. You are shown how to animate the model and develop a basic GUI so users can run the model with different parametrers without having to modify the source code.</p>
=======
<p>These web pages are
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources">Open Educational Resources</a>
 developed by 
<a href="https://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/people/a.turner/index.html">Andy Turner</a>
 and used for teaching at 
<a href="https://www.leeds.ac.uk">The University of Leeds</a>.
They support learning the basics of computer programming for
applications in geography and social science and focus on the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)">Python programming language</a>
(Python).</p>
<p>In the header of each page is a common navigation section which
should indicate which page you are on with a solid outline, and
in the main section of the page is a level 1 heading containing
the title of the page. At the bottom of each page there is a
footer section which links to the next page (until you are on the
references - the last page). The page before last is an index page
which might be useful to look things up.</p>
<p>At the top of each page is a Style Button that can be used
to change the style of the pages between 'light mode' and 'dark
mode'. When active, and by default, 'light mode', sets the
background of each page white. Contrastingly, 'dark mode', sets
the background of each page black. Other things are restyled
to show up on the background. In dark mode links to external
web resources appear with a dark red background as a warning as
these may not honour browser dark mode settings.</p>
<p>The idea is that learners proceed by reading through the web
pages in order, pausing to think, explore links, take
breaks, perhaps talking with peers, undertake practical
exercises as directed, and expriment.</p>
<p>There are links to other websites, particularly the official
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/">Python 3 Documentation</a>
which is widely consulted to learn about the language.</p>
<p>The hope is that you will learn a lot and quickly by running
code provided and writing your own code. Try to balance your
division of time between theory and practice. An appropriate
balance will depend on your experience and how you personally
learn best.</p>
<p>On courses with computer practical sessions in a classroom,
working with others in pairs or small groups with ready access to
help from tutors is encouraged. Tutors are there to discuss things
and provide practical demonstration to help you learn and avoid
confusion.</p>
<p>Learning new things is tiring. With increasing tiredness comes
decreased ability to learn. So, try to manage your time and make
good use of your special learning abilities when you have them.
And most importantly - take breaks and look after yourself
mentally and physically.</p>

<h2>4. The Learning Journey</h2>
<p>Learning to program involves practical problem solving and
computational thinking. This can involve breaking a problem
down into smaller tasks and repeating a basic workflow to
accomplish each task. The workflow steps are: plan, write,
test, and review.</p>
<p>Take time to develop your understanding and practise your
skills. There is a lot to learn especially if you are new to
programming.</p>
<p>Be experimental and remember to test your understanding and
test that your code does what you expect it to do.</p>
<p>The web pages with names starting "ABM" are a series of
practical exercises that develop an Agent Based Model. It is a
simple model representing animals moving about in an environment,
interacting with each other and the environment. (There is much
that can be done to enhance the model and make it more realistic.)
The model is animated and run using a basic Graphical User
Interface. Data are read from files and are scraped from a Web
page to initialise the model, and data is output to files and
messages are provided to the user via the standard output.
</p>

<h2>5. Platform/Software</h2>
<p>All the software used in this course is Free and Open Source
Software (FOSS) which is available to download and install on most
platforms.<p>
<p>The software is available to University of Leeds staff and
students via AppsAnywhere on it's Academic Windows Virtual Desktop
which can be accessed via a Web browser and the following URL:
<a href="https://wvd.leeds.ac.uk">https://wvd.leeds.ac.uk</a>.
We will be making use of
<a href="https://www.anaconda.com/">Anaconda</a> - a data science
platform, and
<a href="https://qgis.org/">QGIS</a> Desktop - Geographical
Information System software.
