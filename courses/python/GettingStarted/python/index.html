<h1>Python</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)">Python</a> is a popular and powerful interpretted programming language. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely available in source and binary form for all major platforms from the <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python Website</a>, and may be freely distributed. The <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python Website</a> contains distributions of and pointers to many free third party Python modules, programs and tools, and additional documentation.</p>
<p>Python underwent a major revision from Python 2 to Python 3 in around 2008. There were changes that were not backwards compatible. As a result a lot of Python 2 code needed changing/fixing (refactoring) in order to work in Python 3 environments. This somewhat divided the community. Python 2 is no longer supported, so reported issues with Python 2 are unlikely to be fixed. On the 22nd of August 2022 Python 3.10.6 was released whilst Python 3.11 was in a pre-release testing phase and Python 3.12 was under development. The language development is somewhat open, so developers can get involved and information is provided about development proposals and the status of proposed enhancements. With each main release of Python 3 there is a "whatsnew" Web page that summarises and links to details of the changes:</p>

<p>On whatsnew Web pages, changes are marked against Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs). These are community proposed and have their own website:<a href="https://peps.python.org/">https://peps.python.org/</a></p>
<p>It is important to know exactly which version of Python you are using and what versions of any third party modules you are using. This helps with reproducing results and diagnosing issues.</p>
<h2>Checking for Python and installing Anaconda</h2>
<p>Check if Python is avalable on your system: start a terminal or command window and enter: "python --version"</p>
<p>That should report the version of python on your system if it is found or report an error.</p>
<p>Please download and install <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/">Anaconda</a> or use the distribution available to you. If installing, then choose the option to add Python to your PATH when prompted, and use the default for all the other installation options.</p>
<h2>First steps</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/">getting started tutorial</a> linked from the <a href="https://www.python.org/">https://www.python.org/</a> is a good place to start learning Python. We will be covering a lot of the same things in this course, but we will be going about it in a more geographical way. If you are being tutored at university, then please keep working with these learning resources for now.</p>
<p>Python instructions or commands are entered at a prompt or passed in files to be interpretted. Commands entered at a prompt are run one at a time. When program files are run, typically multiple instructions are run. Let us get going now with a bit of Python coding practise.</p>
<p>Start a terminal or command window and enter the command:</p><pre>python</pre>
<p>The prompt should change to look more like:</p><pre>>>></pre>
<p>This is the Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) environment for Python where user inputs are read and evaluated, and then the results are returned to the user. This is commonly called "the Python prompt" and the terminal or command window the "console".
<p>Enter:</p> <pre>2 + 3</pre>
<p>You should see the following printed in the console:</p><pre>5</pre>
<p>Have a play and use this Python REPL environment to do some mathematical calculations.</p>
<p>The following is used for multiplication:</p><pre>*</pre>
<p>Try multiplying two numbers.</p>
<p>The following is used for division:</p>
<p><pre>/</pre></p>
<p>The following is used for raising to a power:</p><pre>**</pre>
<p>Have a go at calculating some larger and smaller numbers.</p>
<p>Many operators can also be accessed via a function in the "operator" module.</p>
<p>Enter: <pre>operator.add(2, 3)</pre></p>
<p>You should get a "NameError" informing you that the interpretter does not know about the module named "operator".</p>
<p>To use functions in the "operator" module we first have to import the "operator" module! Before doing that, check what modules your Python environment does know about by entering:
<pre>dir()</pre></p>
<p>This runs (or calls) the "dir" function. (You can tell it is a function call as after the name there is a start parenthesis "(". The function call is completed by the end parenthesis ")"). The "dir" function takes no arguments - things that are passed to the function - as there is nothing between the start and end parentheses. (If multiple arguments are passed to a function they are separated by a delimeter - a comma (","))</p>
<p>You should get a list printed out that looks like: <pre>['__annotations__', '__builtins__', '__doc__', '__loader__', '__name__', '__package__', '__spec__']</pre></p>
<p>You can tell this is a list as it starts with "[" and ends with "]" and the elements are separated with a commas (",") - well, in printing these out it appears as commas and spaces.</p>
<p>Enter: <pre>import operator</pre></p>
<p>This imports the "operator" module.</p>
<p>Enter: <pre>dir()</pre></p>
<p>You should now see the "operator" module in the list.</p>
<p>Enter: <pre>operator.add(2, 3)</pre></p>
<p>You should see <pre>5</pre> printed in the console.</p>
<p>Enter: <pre>dir(operator)</pre></p>
<p>This lists all the functions in the "operator" module. It is quite a long list and contains "add", the function that we called to add the numbers 2 and 3. There are numerous functions that have a name starting and ending with "__". These are not supposed to be called directly, but they can be called.</p>
<p>Enter: <pre>operator.__add__(2, 3)</pre></p>
<p>Python does not have a way of exerting access control on variables or functions, so it uses a naming convention to indicate to users that the variable or function should not be accessed from outside the module. Variables with names that start with a single underscore ("_") or double underscore "__" are generally not supposed to be used directly.</p>
<p>Enter: <pre>help(operator.add)</pre></p>
<p>This prints out some information about how to use the "operator" module "add" function.</p>
<p>Enter: <pre>help()</pre></p>
<p>This enters the help system and the prompt changes to look like</p><pre>help</pre>
<p>Read what is printed.</p>
<p>Enter: <pre>modules</pre></p>
<p>Enter: <pre>operator</pre></p>
<p>This is the help documentation for the operator module. It is many lines long. Press and hold the &lt;enter&gt; key to get the next lines of the help documentation and let go after a few lines. Try pressing your &lt;space bar&gt; key to get the next page of the help documentation. Usually you can keep pressing your &lt;space bar&gt; key to scan through this help documentation until you exit. You can also press your &lt;q&gt; key to quit and return to the help system.</p>
<p>Enter: <pre>q</pre></p>
<p>This should exit the help system and return you to the Python prompt.</p>
<p>Call the "quit" function to quit the Python REPL i.e. Enter: <pre>quit()</pre></p>
<p>This should return you to the normal command prompt.</p>
<p>Next, let us put some commands in a file and run the file.</p>
<p>Open a text editor, add the following lines, then save the file with the name "test.py":</p>
<pre>
import operator
print(operator.add(10, 15))
</pre>
<p>From the normal command prompt run: <pre>python test.py</pre></p>
<p>This should run the program and the output should be displayed in the terminal or command window.</p>
<p>Let's try running Python a third way, in a "Jupyter notebook"</p>
<p>In the normal terminal or command window enter the following at the command prompt: <pre>jupyter notebook</pre></p>
<p>That should open up a browser running Jupyter with the "Files" tab open. The other tabs are "Running" and "Clusters".</p>
<p>In the "Files" tab select <pre>New > python 3</pre></p>
<p>That should open up a new browser tab with a Jupyter notebook with the name "Untitled".</p>
<p>Enter the following into the box with the "In [1]" prompt:<pre>
import operator
print(operator.add(10, 15))
</pre></p>
<p>Click the "Run" button and watch what happens.</p>
<p>Look back at the main Jupyter notebook tab and then return to this notebook.</p>
<p>Click "File > Save as" then enter a filename "test".</p>
<p>Close the browser Window and Click "Quit" in the main Jupyter notebook tab.</p>
<p>Look back at the terminal or command window. Jupyter should be "Shut down" or "Shutting down". If it gets stuck then interupt or kill the terminal or command window and start a new one. Run:</p><pre>Jupyter notebook</pre>Load "test.ipynb" - the notebook you just created.</p>
<p>Have a play with the 3 different ways of running Python you have just learned about so that you become more familiar with them.</p>
