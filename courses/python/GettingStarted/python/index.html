<h1>Python</h1>
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)">Python</a>
is a popular and powerful interpretted programming language. The
Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely
available in source and binary form for all major platforms from
the
<a href="https://www.python.org/">Python Website</a>
, and may be freely distributed. The 
<a href="https://www.python.org/">Python Website</a>
contains distributions of and pointers to many free third party
Python modules, programs and tools, and additional documentation.
</p>
<p>Python underwent a major revision from Python 2 to Python 3 in
around 2008. There were changes that were not all backward
compatible. As a result a lot of Python 2 code needed
changing/fixing (refactoring) in order to work in Python 3
environments. This somewhat divided the community. Python 2 is no
longer supported in that the Python developers are no longer
responding to issues reported against Python 2.</p>
<p>On October 4, 2021 Python 3.10 was released. On November 24th,
2022 Python 3.11 was released. For each of these incremental
releases there are "whatsnew" Web pages:</p>
<ul>
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew"></a>
<li><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.0.html">Whatsnew Python 3.0</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.1.html">Whatsnew Python 3.1</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.2.html">Whatsnew Python 3.2</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.3.html">Whatsnew Python 3.3</a></li>

<li><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.11.html">Whatsnew Python 3.11</a></li>
</ul>
<p>On "whatsnew" Web pages, changes are marked against Python
Enhancement Proposals (PEPs). These are community proposed and
allow us to look ahead and see what might change. PEPs have their
own Web site:
<a href="https://peps.python.org/">https://peps.python.org/</a>
</p>
<p>It is important to know exactly which version of Python you are
using and what versions of any third party modules you are using.
This helps with reproducing results and diagnosing issues.</p>
<p>Programming and programming language development are
community activities. It is normal to ask others for help and to
provide others with help and work collaboratively to develop
things. There are different types of forums for asking and
answering questions and different types of project that you might
want to get involved with once you have gained some experience.
Please refrain from asking questions on any forums unless you are
encouraged to do so by your tutor. Please ask your tutor for help
if you want it. If asking for help by email, it is often a good
idea to attach your code, explain what you think should happen and
describe what happens instead.</p>
<p>The
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/">getting started tutorial</a>
linked from the
<a href="https://www.python.org/">https://www.python.org/</a>
is a good place to start learning Python. This course covers
much of that but in a slightly different geographically focussed
way.</p>
<h2>2. Running Python</h2>
<p>Python instructions or commands are entered at a prompt or
passed in files to be interpretted. There is an order in which
instructions run. Program files may contain new types of
instructions called functions that can be accessed and run from
other files of a program.</p>
<p>These instructions assume that you have
<a href="https://www.anaconda.com/">Anaconda</a>
installed. When installing Anoconda, please choose
the option to add to your Path (which is not the default option).
</p>
<p>Open up a terminal or command window and enter:</p>
<pre>python --version</pre>
<p>This should output the version of Python your system is set up
to use. If Python is not on your Path, then you should get an
error message.</p>
<p>Enter the following command:</p>
<pre>python</pre>
<p>The prompt should change to look more like:</p>
<pre>>>></pre>
<p>This is the Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) environment for Python
where user inputs are read and evaluated, and then the results
are returned to the user. We call this "the Python prompt".</p>
<p>Enter:</p>
<pre>2 + 3</pre>
<p>You should see the result of adding the number 2 to the number
3:</p>
<pre>5</pre>
<p>The Python REPL environment can act as a basic calculator.</p>
<p>Using the operator symbol for multiplication (*), try
multiplying two numbers.</p>
<p>Have a little play perhaps also trying the operator symbol for
division (/)...</p>
<p>Mathematical operators can also be accessed via functions that
reside in the "operator" module.</p>
<p>Enter:</p>
<pre>operator.add(2, 3)</pre>
<p>You should see the following error message:</p>
<pre>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'operator' is not defined</pre>
<p>The error is that the interpretter does not know about the
module named "operator"</p>
<p>Enter:</p>
<pre>dir()</pre>
<p>This runs (or calls) the "dir" function. You can tell it is
a function as after the name there are start and end parentheses
(()). In this case, the function is passed no arguments as there
is nothing between the start and end parentheses.</p>
<p>You should get a list printed out that looks like:</p>
<pre>['__annotations__', '__builtins__', '__doc__', '__loader__',
'__name__', '__package__', '__spec__']</pre>
<p>You can tell this is a list as it starts with an open square
bracket ([) and ends with a closing square bracket (]), and each
element is separated with a comma (,).</p>
<p>Enter:</p
<pre>import operator</pre>
<p>This imports the "operator" module.</p>
<p>Enter:</p>
<pre>dir()</pre>
<p>This time, you should see the "operator" module in the list.
</p>
<p>Enter:</p>
<pre>operator.add(2, 3)</pre>
<p>This time, you should see the result:</p>
<pre>5</pre>
<p>Enter:</p>
<pre>dir(operator)</pre>
<p>This lists all the functions in the "operator" module. It is
quite a long list that contains the "add" function that was
called to add the numbers 2 and 3.</p>
<p>Notice that there are numerous functions that have a name
starting and ending with "__". These are not supposed to be
called directly, but they can be.</p>
<p>Enter:</p>
<pre>operator.__add__(2, 3)</pre>
<p>Python does not have a way of exerting access control on
variables or functions, so it uses a naming convention to
indicate to users that the variable or function should not be
accessed from outside the module. Variables with names that start
with a single underscore ("_") or double underscore "__"
should not be accessed or used directly.</p>
<p>Enter:</p>
<pre>help(operator.add)</p>
<p>This prints out some information about how to use the"
  + " "operator" module "add" function.</p>
<p>Enter:</p>
<pre>help()</pre>
<p>This enters the help system and the prompt changes to look
like:</p>
<pre>help> </pre>
<p>Read what is printed.</p>
<p>Enter:</p>
<pre>modules</pre>
<p>This may take a while to build a list of available modules.
It takes longer the first time you run it.</p>
<p>Within a few minutes, a list of modules should be returned.
If you don't want to wait for this to be returned, then open
another command prompt and do something else while you are
waiting.</p>
<p>At the help prompt enter:</p>
<pre>operator</pre>
<p>This is the help documentation for the operator module. It is
many lines long. Press and hold the <enter> key to get the next
lines of the help documentation and let go after a few lines have
appeared. Then try pressing the <space bar> key to get the next
page of the help documentation. Usually you can keep pressing the
<space bar> key to scan through the help documentation until you
exit. You could also press your <q> key to quit and return to the
help system.</p>
<p>Enter:</p>
<pre>q</pre>
<p>This should exit the help system and return you to the Python
prompt.</p>
<p>Enter:</p>
<pre>quit()</pre>
<p>This should quit the Python REPL environment and return you
to the normal command prompt.</p>
<p>Before learning how to run a file of Python commands, let us
go through some basics of Python syntax.
<h2>3. Basic Python Syntax</h3>
<h3>3.1. Statements</h3>
<p>Multiple statements on a single line are separated with"
  + " semicolons (;).</p>
<p>Python does not have a special symbol to end a statement"
  + " like many languages do.</p>
<h3>3.2. Comments</h3>
<p>The # symbol is the start of a comment.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">
# This entire line is a comment
x = 0 # This part of the line is a comment
print(x) # Print out the value of x
# Comments should be informative.
# x = 1 # Commented code is not run.
</code></pre>
<p>Between triple quotes everything is a comment. There are two
types of triple quote, those using single quotation marks, and
those using double quotation marks. Triple double quotes (""")
are typically used for documentation. Triple single quotes (''')
are often used to comment out sections of code when
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugging">debugging</a>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">
"""
This is between triple quotes and is a comment.
"""
</code></pre>
<p>It is good practise to leave a comment to indicate why a
section of code has been commented out. Comments aim to help make
code easier to read and understand. What is an appropriate amount
of comment depends. Sometimes it is good to refer to other
information sources in comments.</p>
<h3>3.3. Code layout: code blocks</h3>
<p>Blank lines are allowed and can help structure code into
blocks. It is good practice to start each code block with a
comment that outlines what the code block is for. For example:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">
# Initialise x and y"
x = 2
y = 4
print(x)
print(y)
# Calculate x to the power of y
x ** y
</code></pre>
<p>Indentation is syntax in Python. Indentation refers to the
blank space that precedes text on a line. (It is sometimes called
white space - as code backgrounds were normally white in colour).
It is good to be consistent with indentation and to be aware that
indentation can effect what code does. Also, care must be taken
with spaces and tabs as these are different, but spaces can appear
the same as a tab in many editors. With Python it is recommended
not to use tabs at all in source code and to use multiple spaces
instead to indent. The following is a code block with an example
"if" statement:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">
# if x is greater than y, then print a
if x > y: # This line has the same indent as the comment above.
    print(x) # This line is indented one standard step further.
print("done") # This line is dedented to the previous level.
</code></pre>
<p>In the code above, if the variable x is greater than the
variable y, then the value of x is printed. If the variable x has
not been initialised, then there will be an error:</p>
<pre>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'x' is not defined</pre>
<p>The print function is a built in function that is located in
the __builtins__ module. Have a look at the help for the function
by entering:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">
help(print)
</code></pre>
<h3>3.4. Delimiters, Literals and operators</h3>
<p>Delimiters separate bits of code like blank lines and the
colon (:) in the if statement above. Some delimeters also act as
operators. Here are some to look at:</p>
<pre>(       )       [       ]       {       }
"
  + ",       :       .       ;       @       =       ->
"
  + "+=      -=      *=      /=      //=     %=      @=
"
  + "&=      |=      ^=      >>=     <<=     **=</pre>
<p>The various types of bracket ((), [], {}) are parentheses (()),
square brackets ([]) and curly brackets ({}) also known as braces.
A lot of code uses brackets. Each open bracket ((, [, {) must be
matched with a closing bracket (), ], }). Commas (,), colons (:),
dots (.) and semicolons (;) are also common in code. A common
issue with code can be because of brackets not being closed, so
this is always something worth checking.
</p>
<p>Literals are specific numerical or text values.</p>
<p>Operators are sequences of mathematical symbols that are a
shorthand for functions (e.g. +, -, *, /, %)</p>
<h3>3.5. Identifiers and Keywords</h3>
<p>Identifiers are (for the most part) names of variables. They
are also used for function names, class names and module names.
</p>
<p>Keywords are reserved terms that can't be used for other
things like variable names (e.g. else, for, if, import).</p>
<p>Attempting to use them as variable names results in syntax
errors as in the following where commands were entered at the
python prompt:</p>
<pre>
>>> if = 2
  File "<stdin>", line 1
    if = 2
       ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
</pre>
<p>Notice that the syntax error is pointing at the equals sign
(=). This is because the python interpreter is expecting a
conditional expression after the keyword (if). The actual issue
is that there was an attempt to use a keyword as a variable name.
</p>
<p>For more details of Python language lexicon, see the
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html">Python 3 Lexical Analysis Documentation</a>
</p>
<h4>2.7. Examples</h4>
<p>The following code block is an if statement which has an else"
  + " condition. The way this works is that the expression is "
  + " evaluated and if True, then x is printed otherwise y is"
  + " printed.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">
x = 0
y = 1
# if x is greater than y, then print x
if x > y:
    print("x", x)
else:
    print("y", y)
print("done")
</code></pre>
<p>In this code, the print function is called with both one and
two arguments. There are variables, comments, indentation,
operators and keywords.</p>
<p>Copy the code above, paste it into a text document and save
it with the filename "test.py". Open a terminal or command prompt
change to the directory where you saved the file
(path_to_directory) using:</p>
<pre>cd path_to_directory<pre>
<p>Run the file of python commands using:</p>
<pre>python test.py<pre>
<p>There should be two lines of output printed to the console:
<pre>
y 1
done
</pre>
