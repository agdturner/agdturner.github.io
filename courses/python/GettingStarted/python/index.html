<h1>Python</h1>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)">Python</a> is a popular and powerful interpretted programming language. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely available in source and binary form for all major platforms from the <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python Website</a>, and may be freely distributed. The <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python Website</a> contains distributions of and pointers to many free third party Python modules, programs and tools, and additional documentation.</p>
<p>Python underwent a major revision from Python 2 to Python 3 in around 2008. There were changes that were not backwards compatible. As a result a lot of Python 2 code needed changing/fixing (refactoring) in order to work in Python 3 environments. This somewhat divided the community. Python 2 is no longer supported in that the Python developers are no longer responding to issues reported against Python 2. On the 22nd of August 2022 Python 3.10.6 was released. With each main release of Python 3 there is a "whatsnew" Web page:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.0.html">Whatsnew Python 3.0</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.1.html">Whatsnew Python 3.1</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.2.html">Whatsnew Python 3.2</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.3.html">Whatsnew Python 3.3</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.4.html">Whatsnew Python 3.4</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.5.html">Whatsnew Python 3.5</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.6.html">Whatsnew Python 3.6</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.7.html">Whatsnew Python 3.7</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.8.html">Whatsnew Python 3.8</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.9.html">Whatsnew Python 3.9</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.10.html">Whatsnew Python 3.10</a></li>
</ul>
<p>On whatsnew Web pages, changes are marked against Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs). These are community proposed and allow us to look ahead and see what might change in subsequent versions of Python. PEPs have their own Web site: <a href="https://peps.python.org/">https://peps.python.org/</a></p>
<p>It is important to know exactly which version of Python you are using and what versions of any third party modules you are using. This helps with reproducing results and diagnosing issues.</p>
<p>Programming and programming language development are community activities. It is normal to ask others for help and to provide others with help and work collaboratively to develop things. There are different types of forums for asking and anwering questions and different types of project that you might want to get involved with once you have gained some experience. In this course, you are discouraged from asking questions on any forums other than our own. But, you are encouraged to search for and use the posts others have made on forums you can access. These may help you complete tasks and understand better, but be sure to keep a track of what you use as it is expected that you refer to these in your academic work. You might want to create forum accounts so that you can up or down vote posts, but until you complete this course please do not make original posts asking for help or reply to posts to help others without first liaising with your tutor. Please ask your tutor for help if you get stuck. If you ask for help by email, it is often a good idea to attach your code, explain what you think should happen and describe what happens instead.</p>
<p>The
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/">getting started tutorial</a>
linked from the
<a href="https://www.python.org/">https://www.python.org/</a>
is a good place to start learning Python. We will be covering a
lot of the same things in this course, but we will be going about
it in a more geographical way.</p>
<p>In Python instructions or commands are entered at a prompt or
passed in files to be interpretted. Commands entered at a prompt
are run one at a time. When program files are run, typically
multiple instructions are run. There is an order in which
instructions run. In some cases the program files that are run
contain new types of instructions.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>To follow the instructions, you should have Python
installed.</p>
<p>Open up a command window and enter:</p>
<pre>python --version</pre>
<p>This should output the version of Python your system is set up
to use. If Python is not on your Path, then you should get an
error message.</p>
<p>Enter the following command:</p>
<pre>python</pre>
<p>The prompt should change to look more like:</p>
<pre>>>></pre>
<p>This is the Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) environment for Python
where user inputs are read and evaluated, and then the results
are returned to the user. We call this "the Python prompt".</p>
<p>Enter:</p>
<pre>2 + 3</pre>
<p>You should see the result of adding the number 2 to the number
3:</p>
<pre>5</pre>
<p>The Python REPL environment can act as a basic calculator.</p>
<p>Using the operator symbol for multiplication (*), try
multiplying two numbers.</p>
<p>Have a little play perhaps also trying the operator symbol for
division (/)...</p>
<p>Mathematical operators can also be accessed via functions that
reside in the "operator" module.</p>
<p>Enter:</p>
<pre>operator.add(2, 3)</pre>
<p>You should see the following error message:</p>
<pre>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'operator' is not defined</pre>
<p>The error is that the interpretter does not know about the
module named "operator"</p>
<p>Enter:</p>
<pre>dir()</pre>
<p>This runs (or calls) the "dir" function. You can tell it is
a function as after the name there are start and end parentheses
(()). In this case, the function is passed no arguments as there
is nothing between the start and end parentheses.</p>
<p>You should get a list printed out that looks like:</p>
<pre>['__annotations__', '__builtins__', '__doc__', '__loader__',
'__name__', '__package__', '__spec__']</pre>
<p>You can tell this is a list as it starts with an open square
bracket ([) and ends with a closing square bracket (]), and each
element is separated with a comma (,).</p>
<p>Enter:</p
<pre>import operator</pre>
<p>This imports the "operator" module.</p>
<p>Enter:</p>
<pre>dir()</pre>
<p>This time, you should see the "operator" module in the list.
</p>
<p>Enter:</p>
<pre>operator.add(2, 3)</pre>
<p>This time, you should see the result:</p>
<pre>5</pre>
<p>Enter:</p>
<pre>dir(operator)</pre>
<p>This lists all the functions in the "operator" module. It is
quite a long list that contains the "add" function that was
called to add the numbers 2 and 3.</p>
<p>Notice that there are numerous functions that have a name
starting and ending with "__". These are not supposed to be
called directly, but they can be.</p>
<p>Enter:</p>
<pre>operator.__add__(2, 3)</pre>
<p>Python does not have a way of exerting access control on
variables or functions, so it uses a naming convention to
indicate to users that the variable or function should not be
accessed from outside the module. Variables with names that start
with a single underscore ("_") or double underscore "__"
should not be accessed or used directly.</p>
<p>Enter:</p>
<pre>help(operator.add)</p>
<p>This prints out some information about how to use the"
  + " "operator" module "add" function.</p>
<p>Enter:</p>
<pre>help()</pre>
<p>This enters the help system and the prompt changes to look
like:</p>
<pre>help> </pre>
<p>Read what is printed.</p>
<p>Enter:</p>
<pre>modules</pre>
<p>This may take a while to build a list of available modules.
It takes longer the first time you run it.</p>
<p>Within a few minutes, a list of modules should be returned.
If you don't want to wait for this to be returned, then open
another command prompt and do something else while you are
waiting.</p>
<p>At the help prompt enter:</p>
<pre>operator</pre>
<p>This is the help documentation for the operator module. It is
many lines long. Press and hold the <enter> key to get the next
lines of the help documentation and let go after a few lines have
appeared. Then try pressing the <space bar> key to get the next
page of the help documentation. Usually you can keep pressing the
<space bar> key to scan through the help documentation until you
exit. You could also press your <q> key to quit and return to the
help system.</p>
<p>Enter:</p>
<pre>q</pre>
<p>This should exit the help system and return you to the Python
prompt.</p>
<p>Enter:</p>
<pre>quit()</pre>
<p>This should quit the Python REPL environment and return you
to the normal command prompt.</p>
