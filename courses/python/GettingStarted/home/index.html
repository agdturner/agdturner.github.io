<h1>Programming for Geography: Python (for beginners)</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Welcome!</p>
<p>If in 'Dark Mode', the 'Style Button' at the top of the page contains the text "Light Mode" and the page background colour is dark and text is lighter. If in 'Light Mode', the Style Button contains the text "Dark Mode" and the page background colour is light and text is darker. You can action the Style Button to change between these modes. The style setting is used for each page in the site. In Dark Mode links to external sites are styled with a dark red background. The site is designed to be accessible. If you have difficulty in using the site, please report issues via the <a href="https://www.github.com/agdturner/agdturner.github.io">agdturner.github.io GitHub Repository</a>.</p>
<p>The course Web pages are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources">Open Educational Resources</a> developed by <a href="https://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/people/a.turner/index.html">Andy Turner</a> and used for teaching at <a href="https://www.leeds.ac.uk">The University of Leeds</a>. The pages support learning the basics of computer programming in general and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)">Python programming language</a> (Python) in particular.</p>
<p>In the header of each page is a navigation section which links to the other pages. The navigation section is essentially the same for all the web pages. The link for the currently loaded page has a thin green outline. After the navigation section is a level 1 heading containing the title of the page.</p>
<p>At the bottom of each page there is a footer section which links to the next page (until the last page - a page of references). The page before last is an index page which links back to sections of pages a bit like the index of a text book.</p>
<p>Please go through the pages in order pausing to think, explore links, take breaks, perhaps talk with peers, and undertake practical exercises as directed. It may help you to repeat read some sections or pages before moving on.</p>
<p>There are many links to other websites in these pages, including Wikipedia articles about programming concepts and Python documentation. Don't worry, you don't need to fully understand things before moving on. Try not to get lost in too much detail as you read.</p>
<p>Reading programming language documentation can be a very good way to learn about any language, especially if you are familiar with other programming languages. The style and layout of the documentation for any particular language may take a bit of getting used to, but it is worth getting familiar with this as you practise.</p>
<p>Learning new things is tiring and can be very difficult or impossible to do if you are tired. Try to keep this in mind and manage your time to make good use of your special learning abilities when you have them. Take breaks, look after yourself and try to enjoy the learning journey.</p>

<li>Developing a basic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface">Graphical User Interface</a> (GUI)</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Learning Journey</h2>
<p>Learning to program involves practical problem solving and computational thinking (such as breaking a problem into a set of smaller tasks). The main workflow is to: plan, write, test, and review.</p>
<p>You are encouraged to be experimental and take your time to develop your understanding and practise your skills. There is a lot to learn especially if you are new to programming.</li>
<p>Following instructions, you are encouraged to develop a simple Agent Based Model (ABM) that represents animals moving about in an environment, interacting with each other and the environment. You are shown how to animate the model and develop a basic GUI so users can run the model with different parametrers without having to modify the source code.</p>
