<h1>Introduction to Python Programming for Geography and Social Science</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Welcome!</p>
<p>These web pages are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources">Open Educational Resources</a> developed by <a href="https://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/people/a.turner/index.html">Andy Turner</a> and used for teaching at <a href="https://www.leeds.ac.uk">The University of Leeds</a>. They support learning the basics of computer programming for applications in geography and social science and focus on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)">Python programming language</a> (Python).</p>
<p>In the header of each web page is a navigation section which links to all the other web pages. The navigation section is essentially the same for all the web pages. To help know which page you are on, the link for that page has a solid outline, and in the main section there is a level 1 heading containing the title of the page. At the bottom of each web page there is a footer section which links to the next page (until you are on the last page - a page of references). The page before last is an index page which links back to sections of web pages to help look things up within the pages.</p>
<p>At the top of each page is a Style Button that can be used to change the style of the pages between 'light mode' and 'dark mode'. When active, and by default, 'light mode', sets the background of each page white. Contrastingly, 'dark mode', sets the background of each page black. Other things may be restyled to show up on the background.</p>
<p>The idea is that learners proceed by reading through the web pages in order, pausing to think, exploring links, taking breaks, perhaps talking with peers, and undertake practical exercises as directed.</p>
<p>There are many links to other websites, particularly Python documentation which, once you get the hang of reading it, is a great way to learn about the language. However, you will also learn a lot by running code and writing your own code. It is hard to prescribe a blanace between reading and writing as eveyone is different, but most people learn fastest with about an even split of reading and writing to begin with.</p>
<p>On courses with computer practical sessions in a classroom, students I teach work through these resources either on their, or in pairs and with ready access to help from tutors. Tutors may give practical demonstrations and help to speed up learning. Those learning remotely typically have access to other means to interact with tutors and peers. Yet, these resources can also be followed by anyone wanting to 'go it alone' and teach themselves. Anyway, I hope you find these resources helpful and that they help make the world a better place!</p>
<p>Learning new things is tiring and can be very difficult or impossible if you are tired. When you are tired, but not too tired, you may be able to churn out work as a programmer, especially things you already know how to do and have practiced lots, but working tired can often be a waste of time as it can be easy to make mistakes and get things in a mess. Try to keep this in mind and manage your time and make good use of your special learning abilities when you have them. And very importantly - remember to take breaks and look after yourself. There is always more to learn and the more you know, the more you know you don't know and the more you realise how fast things are changing and how much more there is to learn. It is very hard to keep up with every change, so my advice is to focus on what you need. In the Python philosophy "good enough" is what you should strive for.</p>
<h2>Syllabus</h2>
<p>General computer programming concepts including:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(computer_science)">Variables</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow">Control flow</a>(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_(computer_programming)">conditionals</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_loop">for loops</a>)</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(computer_programming)">Classes</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(computer_programming)">functions</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_(computer_programming)">methods</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Testing code works as expected and dealing with 'edge cases'.</p>
<p>Documenting code, producing documentation for other programmers and documentation for software end users.</p>
<p>Programming (particularly Python) language development.</p>
<p>Python limitations.</p>
<p>Jupyter Notebooks.</p>
<p>Version control.</p>
<p>GitHub.</p>
<h2>Expectations</h2>
<p>You will practice developing Python code to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Input data into programs from files and from the Web</li>
<li>Output data to files.</li>
<li>Use data structures to process <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_system">coordinates</a>.</li>
<li>Display spatial data using <a href="https://matplotlib.org/">matplotlib</a>.</li>
<li>Process raster data.</li>
<li>Develop and visualise a dynamic spatial simulation controlled from and displayed within a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface">Graphical User Interface</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Learning Journey</h2>
<p>Learning to program involves practical problem solving and computational thinking. This can involve breaking a problem down into smaller tasks and repeating a basic workflow to  accomplish each task. The workflow steps are: plan, write, test, and review.</p>
<p>Take time to develop your understanding and practise your skills. There is a lot to learn especially if you are new to programming.</li>
<p>Be experimental and remember to test your understanding and test that your code does what you expect it to do.</p>
<p>The web pages with names starting "ABM" are a series of  practicals that develop an Agent Based Model. It is a simplistic model representing animals moving about in an environment, interacting with each other and the  environment. (There is much that can be done to enhance the model and make it more realistic.) Developing such a model </p>
