<h1>Introduction to Python Programming for Geography and Social Science</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Welcome!</p>
<p>This is the home page of a set of web pages that are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources">Open Educational Resources</a> developed by <a href="https://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/people/a.turner/index.html">Andy Turner</a> and used for teaching at <a href="https://www.leeds.ac.uk">The University of Leeds</a>. The web pages are for learning the basics of computer programming as might be applied in geography and social science using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)">Python programming language</a> (Python). At university it is normal to go through these resources on a course with others and with the help of a tutor. In classroom teaching, a tutor may provide practical demonstrations, lead discussion sessions and organise  students to work together, discuss and explain things to each other. Those learning remotely are likely to use other means to interact with a tutor and peers. However, these resources can also be followed by anyone wanting to 'go it alone' and teach themselves.</p>
<p>In the header of each web page is a navigation section which links to all the other web pages. The navigation section is essentially the same for all the web pages. To help know which page you are on, the link for that page has a solid outline, and in the main section there is a level 1 heading containing the title of the page. At the bottom of each web page there is a footer section which links to the next page until you are on the last page - a page of references. The page before last is an index page which links back to sections of web pages to help look things up within the pages.</p>
<p>At the top of each page is a Style Button that can be used to change the style of the pages between 'light mode' and 'dark mode'. When active, and by default, 'light mode', sets the background of each page white. Contrastingly, 'dark mode', sets the background of each page black. Other things may be restyled to show up on the background.</p>
<p>The idea is that learners proceed by reading through the web pages in order and pausing to have breaks and to undertake practical exercises as directed. There is extra detail that might be best to skim or skip over the first time you read through a web page. Some detail might be best not to return to until after you have read through more or all the web pages.</p>
<p>Learning new things is tiring and can be very difficult or impossible if you are tired. When you are tired, but not too tired, you may be able to use your coding skills to do things that you have already learned how to do. So, try to keep this in mind and manage your time and make good use of your special learning abilities when you have them. And very importantly - remember to take breaks, rest and recouperate and look after yourself.</p>
<h2>Syllabus</h2>
<p>General computer programming concepts including:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(computer_science)">Variables</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow">Control flow</a>(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_(computer_programming)">conditionals</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_loop">for loops</a>)</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(computer_programming)">Classes</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(computer_programming)">functions</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_(computer_programming)">methods</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Testing code works as expected and dealing with 'edge cases'.</p>
<p>Documenting code, producing documentation for other programmers and documentation for software end users.</p>
<p>Programming (particularly Python) language development.</p>
<p>Python limitations.</p>
<p>Jupyter Notebooks.</p>
<p>Version control.</p>
<p>GitHub.</p>
<h2>Expectations</h2>
<p>You will practice developing Python code to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Input data into programs from files and from the Web</li>
<li>Output data to files.</li>
<li>Use data structures to process <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_system">coordinates</a>.</li>
<li>Display spatial data using <a href="https://matplotlib.org/">matplotlib</a>.</li>
<li>Process raster data.</li>
<li>Develop and visualise a dynamic spatial simulation controlled from and displayed within a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface">Graphical User Interface</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Learning Journey</h2>
<p>Learning to program involves practical problem solving and computational thinking. This can involve breaking a problem down into smaller tasks and repeating a basic workflow to  accomplish each task. The workflow steps are: plan, write, test, and review.</p>
<p>Take time to develop your understanding and practise your skills. There is a lot to learn especially if you are new to programming.</li>
<p>Be experimental and remember to test your understanding and test that your code does what you expect it to do.</p>
<p>The web pages with names starting "ABM" are a series of  practicals that develop an Agent Based Model. It is a simplistic model representing animals moving about in an environment, interacting with each other and the  environment. (There is much that can be done to enhance the model and make it more realistic.) Developing such a model </p>
