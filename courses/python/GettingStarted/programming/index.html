<h1>Programming</h1>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming">Computer programming</a> (programming, or coding) is about instructing a computer to carry out a set of tasks. Typically, the tasks involve data that are input and processed. Outputs may be new or modified data files, data displayed on the computerscreen and sounds played through speekers.</p>
<p>The first computers were human calculators. These days most computers are electrical machines with circuits. Desktop machines typically have a keyboard for user inputs, process binary data stored in a file system and have a graphical display. Machines are typically networked and can communicate with other similar machines on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet">Internet</a>.</p>
<p>Programming can be done visually by arranging pre-built components that fit or connect together to form programs or workflows that can then be run to produce output. However, this course is not about visual programming, it is about programming using text commands written in a computer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language">Programming_language</a> and either entered at a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface#Command_prompt">Command Prompt</a> one after another or passed to an interpretter in a file or a set of files. (A file is an ordered collection of data that is registered with the computer operating system and can be persistently stored (made so that it is available in subsequent computer sessions).)</p>
<p>There are a wide variety of computer programming languages each defined by a specific syntax (rules). Like natural languages, computer languages can share a lot in common and can look completely different. These learning resources focus on Python and will mention some similarities and differences that are useful to be aware of.</p>
<p>The smallest amount of binary data is called a bit - one or the other state. Perhaps it is easiest to think of these states as being a zero or a one.</p>
<p>Typically computers work with fixed size collections of bits called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte">bytes</a>. The more more bits in a byte, the more different unique combinations there are. With each added bit there is a power of two more combinations. With 2 bits there are 4 possible combinations of zeros and ones (00, 01, 10, 11). With 3 bits there are 8 combinations (000, 001, 010, 100, 011, 101, 110, 111). With 4, 16... With 8, 256...</p>
<p>Many encodings use 8 bits in a byte (as this allows for all English letters in both lower and upper case, the ten numeric digits 0 to 9, and 192 mathematical and other symbols to be uniquely represented. To represent individual numbers, computers typically use more bits depending on the type of number. We will come back to numerical representations and calculations later.</p>
<p>The lowest level languages are called machine languages and these tell the computer how to read instructions and transfer data. Higher level languages like Python have interpretters that translate more human readable code into the machine language.</p>
<p>If you are new to computer programming, then you will be learning lots of new terms and concepts as well as learning the syntax of Python in this course. There is a lot to take on board and you will be most ready to learn these new things when you are well rested and able to concentrate. You are strongly encouraged to take breaks when you are learning and allow time for the concepts and new terminology to sink in. Taking breaks will almost certainly help you to learn faster on the whole as you tap you subconscious. Learning should be a joy, but it is not so much fun if you are not making progress which can happen if you try to work when you are tired. Learning to program requires practice and will inevitable involve making lots of mistakes - a bit like learning to play a musical instrument. Most learning computer programming learn best by doing practical exercises and reusing the code they have written.</p>
<p>There is typically more to learn with the first computer programming language you learn. Once you can use one, it is much easier to learn another.</p>
