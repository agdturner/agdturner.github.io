<h1>Programming</h1>
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming">Computer programming</a>
(coding) is about instructing a computing machine (computer) to
carry out a set of tasks where data is typically input, processed
and output. Computers are typically networked through connections
to other devices and other computers.</p>
<p>Desktop and laptop computers typically have: a keyboard and
mouse for user input and a visual display screen; smaller amounts
of faster more volatile data storage (memory), and larger amounts
of more persistent data storage (disk) that uses a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system">file system</a>.
Computers may have inbuilt or perpherally connected microphones
and cameras, and the screen may be a touch screen. Networked
computers can typically communicate with other machines on the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet">Internet</a>.
The basic functioning of the computer is handled by an 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system">operating system</a>
 that is configured to run when 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booting">booted</a>.
Additional 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software">software</a>
can be added and run on the operating system to extend the
capability of the computer. This includes
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language">computer programming language</a>
interpretters and run time environments which allow programs
to be compiled and run.</p>
<p>Programming can be done visually by arranging pre-built
components that fit or connect together to form workflows that
can be run. However, this course is not about visual programming,
it is about programming using text based command instructions
written specifically in the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)">Python programming language</a>.</p>
<p>There are a wide variety of computer programming languages
each defined by a specific syntax. Some computer languages
look similar, some look very different. Whilst these learning
resources focus on Python, occasionally similarities and
differences between Python and other languages are pointed out.
</p>
<h2>2. Data</h2>
<p>In most modern computers, data is encoded in a binary form
where the smallest unit is called a bit which is in one of two
possible states. Let us lable these one (1) and zero (0).</p>
<p>Typically computers work with fixed size collections of bits
called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte">bytes</a>.
The more more bits in a byte, the more different unique
combinations or arrangements of bits in the byte there are. With
each added bit, there is a power of two more combinations. With 2
bits there are 4 possible combinations (00, 01, 10, 11). With 3
bits there are 8 combinations (000, 001, 010, 100, 011, 101, 110,
111). With 4, 16... With 8, 256...</p>
<p>Many encodings use 8 bits in a byte (as this allows for all
English letters in both lower and upper case, the ten numeric
digits 0 to 9, and with capacity let for 192 other symbols to be
uniquely represented. To represent individual numbers, computers
typically use more bits depending on the type of number. Let us
consider numerical representations and calculations in more detail
later in the course...</p>
<h2>3. Learning to Program</h2>
<p>If you are new to computer programming, then you will learn
lots of new terms and concepts as you learn the basics of Python
in this course. There is a lot to learn which can be tiring and so
you are strongly encouraged to take breaks as to help you learn
faster and avoid fatigue. Learning should be a joy, but it is not
much fun if you make slow progress and keep forgetting things
which is much more likely to happen if you are tired. When you are
not tired, sometimes you might struggle to understand something
too. This is perfectly normal. With some things, it can take
several attempts to understand something even when others seem to
understand that thing seemingly easily.</p>
<p>Once you can program well in one language, it is generally much
easier to learn to programme in another language. Once you know
two languages well, you might use one to do some things and
another to do other things and you might be more confident to try
another language.</p>
<p>Programming and programming language development are typically
community activities. It is normal to ask others for help and to
provide others with help and work collaboratively to develop
things. There are different types of forums for asking and
answering questions and different types of project that you might
want to get involved with once you have gained some experience.
Please refrain from asking questions on any forums unless you are
encouraged to do so by your tutor. Please ask your tutor for help
if you want it. If asking for help by email, it is often a good
idea to attach your code, explain what you think should happen and
describe what happens instead.</p>
<h2>4. Considerata</h2>
<p>High level languages evolve. New functionality is added and
syntax can change to allow for more compact or easier to
understand expressions. This can mean that code written in an
older version of a language might appear different. In some
language evolution, old versions of the syntax are broken and
it is no longer guaranteed that code will run as expected and so
needs reviewing and testing again and potentially refactoring
(reworking) so that it will work again. It is important to be
aware of this when learning to program. Everything that you do and
use needs to be reviewed and tested.</p>
<p>Sometimes language evolution results in syntactic changes such
that a ot of code writing in adherence to an old syntax will not
necessarily work in the newer interpretters that convert that
syntax into machine readble instructions.</p>
<p>With any given syntax, there are usually a plethora of
different ways to achieve the same or a similar thing. Some ways
might be computationally faster under all or particular
circumstances, some might be more memory efficient, some may work
on a more diverse range of inputs, and in a range of cases all
these different ways might result in the same answers or
behaviour. In other cases, some ways might be more precise or
accurate. For some tasks, it is likely to get a large variation in
the ways different people will implement a solution in a given
language, for others tasks, there may only be subtle differences
such as in the names of the variables used or functions defined.
In learning to program, it is often good to review how others have
done the same or similar things. It is a good way to learn so long
as you pick up good habits and not bad habits.</p>
<p>In general you are encouraged to produce easy to understand,
easy to maintain, efficient, reliable, well tested and well
documented code. Only a fraction of the code used today is like
this. Also it is worth bearing in mind that not all code is used
to make the world a better place. Please take care to review code
before you run it just in case the code is nefarious. Also, please
adhere to the terms and conditions of software licenses, keep a
track of what you use and what is useful and attribute others work
as appropriate.</p>
