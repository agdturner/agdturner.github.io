<h1>Programming</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming,_also_known_as">Computer programming, also known as</a> coding, is about instructing a computer to carry out a set of tasks. Typically this involves data that are input, processed and output. Outputs may also be visual displays and sounds, and a computer can be used to control other things like motors and sensors.</p>
<p>Different computers have different input and output devices. Current desktop and laptop machines typically have a keyboard and a mouse for user input and a visual display screen. The may also have microphones and cameras, and the screen may be a touch screen..</p>
<p>These computers typically have smaller amounts of faster more volitile data storage (memory), and larger amounts of more persistent data storage known as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system">file system</a>.  They are typically connected to a networked either via a cable, or via a wireless communication module. This allows for communication with other computers on either just a local network, or on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet">Internet</a>. The basic functioning of computer is managed by an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system">operating system</a> that is loaded onto the machine and configured to run when it is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booting">booted</a>. Additional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software">software</a> can be added and run on the operating system to extend the machines capability. This includes things like interpretters or virtual machines which allow users to run programs written in specific <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language">computer programming language</a>s.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_programming">Visual programming</a> involves Workflows that are like programs can often be developed by arranging and connecting components in a graphical display. This is called visual programmingcourse is not about visual programming, it is about programming using text based command instructions written in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)">Python</a>.</p>
<p>There are a wide variety of computer programming languages each defined by a specific syntax (rules). Like natural languages, computer languages can look similar and very different. Whilst these learning resources focus on Python, occasionally similarities and differences between Python and other languages are explained.</p>
<h2>Data</h2>
<p>The smallest amount of binary data is called a bit. It is a unit that is in one of two possible states. Perhaps it is easiest to think of these states as being positive or negative, true or false, or one (1) or zero (0). Let's use 0 or 1 for now.</p>
<p>Typically computers work with fixed size collections of bits called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte">bytes</a>. The more more bits in a byte, the more different unique combinations or arrangements of bits in the byte there are. With each added bit there is a power of two more combinations. With 2 bits there are 4 possible combinations (00, 01, 10, 11). With 3 bits there are 8 combinations (000, 001, 010, 100, 011, 101, 110, 111). With 4, 16... With 8, 256...</p>
<p>Many encodings use 8 bits in a byte (as this allows for all English letters in both lower and upper case, the ten numeric digits 0 to 9, and 192 mathematical and other symbols to be uniquely represented. To represent individual numbers, computers typically use more bits depending on the type of number. We will come back to numerical representations and calculations later.</p>
<h2>Learning to Program</h2>
<p>If you are new to computer programming, then you will be learning lots of new terms and concepts as well as learning the syntax of Python in this course. This can be very tiring, and it can take a while for some things to be fully understood. You are strongly encouraged to take breaks for your own well being and also because this will often help you learn faster.</p>
<p>Learning to program requires practice and typically involves making lots of mistakes - not bad mistakes, good mistakes - ones which you can learn from. In some ways learning to program is a bit like learning to write, or learn to play a musical instrument. It is best to mix up a bit of theory and a bit of practise and not to leave it too long between learning sessions.</p>
<p>There is typically more to learn with the first computer programming language you learn. Once you can program well in one language, it is generally much easier to learn another language. Once you know two languages well, you might turn to one to do some things and another to do other things. Or, you might prefer a particular language for a time.</p>
<p>High level languages are typically evolving to be more  efficient and capable. Often this involves syntactic changes such that old code can look quite different and there can be several ways to do the same thing.</p>
<p>In general, programmers should aim to produce easy to understand, easy to maintain, efficient, reliable, well-tested and well documented code.</p>
<h2>Code Structure</h2>
<p>Programming languages provide for different levels of organisation. Code in a single file might be referred to as a script. It gets cumbersome working with everything in one file, so typically code is separated into multiple files and into reusable parts called functions that may be organised in a hierarchy of classes. If you are writing code to provide a way for others to do things, really, you are developing software and there becomes a need to think about supporting users that may want to use the software without knowing anything about the underlying programming language the software is based on.</p>
<h2>Software and Programming Language Development</h2>
<p>A lot of software is developed by teams of professionals. Code is often reviewed and team members specialise and work together collaboratively. Some team members are more like software testers and user interface designers. It can be helpful for all these team members to have some basic knowledge of computer programming. It is also helpful for software users to understand a bit about computer programming to help them report issues they encounter when using software so that these are more likely to be addressed and fixed over time.</p>
<h2>Asking for help</h2>
<p>Software and programming language development are typically community activities. It is normal to ask others for help and to provide others with help and work collaboratively to develop things. There are different types of forums for asking and anwering questions and different types of project that you might want to get involved with once you have gained some experience. If you are supported by a tutor at university, you are discouraged from posting to forums to ask for help unless you are directed to do this by your tutor. If you have a tutor, please ask your tutor for help if you get stuck. If you ask for help by email, it is often a good idea to attach your code, explain what you think should happen and describe what happens instead. Often your tutor will see the problem right away, but they may want to test things to be sure, so try to make it easy for them to help you.</p>
