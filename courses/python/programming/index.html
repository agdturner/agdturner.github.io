<h1>Programming</h1>
<p>Programming is about instructing a computer to carry out a set of tasks. Typically these involve data that are seperate from the instructions, and their transfer, processing and output in visual and/or audio forms.</p>
<p>Programming can be done via a visual interface that allows programmers to compose workflows made up of components that fit or connect together to represent some sequence of calculation and data processing. However, this course is not about visual programming and is about programming using written instructions that are passed to an interpretter.</p>
<p>There are a wide variety of computer programming languages which have varying syntax (rules) as to how to write instructions. Whilst this course focusses on Python programming, it is helpful to understand ome of the similarities and differences between Python and other commonly used similar languages.</p>
<p>Nearly all modern computers use electrical charge to store and process data. Without going into too much detail, the charge can be used to change the state of data from a zero (0) to a one (1). A single bit of data is thus a 0 or a 1. Typically computers work on fixed size collections of bits called bytes. The number of bits in a byte limits how many different things can be expressed in a single byte. Bytes can be combined to express more, similar to how words in a natural language like English can express far more than the individual letters.</p>
<p>Lower level languages have smaller numbers of different types of instruction, higher level languages can do much more, but these are ultimately compiled into the machine readable low level language when a program is run. Python is a high level language like Java, C# and C++.</p>
<p>Sometimes programming is also called coding. Programming using a computer programming language and interpretter allows for the automation of tasks that may otherwise require the user to manually push buttons or be on hand to figure out what to do and set the next things going once a process has completed.</p>
<p>If you are new to computer programming, then there may be many terms already in this page that are new or are unfamiliar to you. As with learning any language, this is not uncommon and some level of immersion and repetition will help you comprehend. You are not expected to know and undertstand everything to be able to move on. The meaining of some terms will become clearer the more they are used. Gradually you can fill in the gaps in your understanding as you go through the learning resources. Many of you will benefit going through some parts of these resources several times and perhaps go through everything more than once to gain a deeper understanding.</p>
<p>In Python (like in Java) instructions or commands are entered at a prompt or passed in files to be interpretted. Commands entered at a prompt are run one at a time. When program files are run, typically multiple instructions are run and in some cases the program contains new instructions about how to process data which are interpretted too. Using a computer programming language and interpretter allows for the automation of tasks that may otherwise require the user to manually push buttons or be on hand to provide the next instruction. Sometimes programming is also called coding. Before we get on with some Python coding, let us learn a little bit more about that langauge.</p>
