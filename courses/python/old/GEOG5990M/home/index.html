<h1>GEOG5990M Programming for Geographical Information Analysis: Core Skills</h1>
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Welcome!</p>
<p>These web pages are
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources">Open Educational Resources</a>
 developed by 
<a href="https://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/people/a.turner/index.html">Andy Turner</a>
 to introduce programming concepts and the Python programming language for geography to students based at 
<a href="https://www.leeds.ac.uk">The University of Leeds</a>.
<p>At the very top of each page is a Style Button that can be used
to change the style of the pages between Light Mode and Dark Mode.
In Light Mode, the background of each page is lighter. In Dark
Mode the background of each page is darker. In dark mode links to
external sites appear with a dark grey background.</p>
<p>Below the Style Button is a navigation section. The bottom
of each page links to the next page.</p>
<p>If you are here to learn about prThe idea is that learners proceed by reading through the web
pages in order, pausing to think, explore links, take
breaks, perhaps talking with peers, undertake practical
exercises as directed, and expriment.</p>
<p>There are links to other websites, particularly the official
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/">Python 3 Documentation</a>
which is widely consulted to learn about the language.</p>
<p>The hope is that you will learn a lot and quickly by running
code provided and writing your own code. Try to balance your
division of time between theory and practice. An appropriate
balance will depend on your experience and how you personally
learn best.</p>
<p>On courses with computer practical sessions in a classroom,
working with others in pairs or small groups with ready access to
help from tutors is encouraged. Tutors are there to discuss things
and provide practical demonstration to help you learn and avoid
confusion.</p>
<p>Learning new things is tiring. With increasing tiredness comes
decreased ability to learn. So, try to manage your time and make
good use of your special learning abilities when you have them.
And most importantly - take breaks and look after yourself
mentally and physically.</p>

<h2>2. Syllabus</h2>

<a href="https://qgis.org/">QGIS</a> Desktop data processing.</li>
<li>Setting up a profile on

<li>Testing:
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html">
DocTest</a>
and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing">
unit testing</a></li>
<li>Developing documentation: documenting functions;
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pydoc.html">PyDoc</a>
and
<a href="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/">Sphinx</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Expectations</h2>
<p>You will learn about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data input and output</li>
<li>Using data structures to process
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_system">coordinates</a>
</li>
<li>Displaying spatial data using
<a href="https://matplotlib.org/">matplotlib</a>
</li>
<li>Processing raster data stored in lists.</li>
<li>Developing a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface">Graphical User Interface</a>
</li>
<li>Developing and visualising a simplistic Agent Based Model</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. The Learning Journey</h2>
<p>Learning to program involves practical problem solving and
computational thinking. This can involve breaking a problem
down into smaller tasks and repeating a basic workflow to
accomplish each task. The workflow steps are: plan, write,
test, and review.</p>
<p>Take time to develop your understanding and practise your
skills. There is a lot to learn especially if you are new to
programming.</p>
<p>Be experimental and remember to test your understanding and
test that your code does what you expect it to do.</p>
<p>The web pages with names starting "ABM" are a series of
practical exercises that develop an Agent Based Model. It is a
simple model representing animals moving about in an environment,
interacting with each other and the environment. (There is much
that can be done to enhance the model and make it more realistic.)
The model is animated and run using a basic Graphical User
Interface. Data are read from files and are scraped from a Web
page to initialise the model, and data is output to files and
messages are provided to the user via the standard output.
</p>

<h2>5. Platform/Software</h2>
<p>All the software used in this course is Free and Open Source
Software (FOSS) which is available to download and install on most
platforms.<p>
<p>The software is available to University of Leeds staff and
students via AppsAnywhere on it's Academic Windows Virtual Desktop
which can be accessed via a Web browser and the following URL:
<a href="https://wvd.leeds.ac.uk">https://wvd.leeds.ac.uk</a>.
We will be making use of
<a href="https://www.anaconda.com/">Anaconda</a> - a data science
platform, and
<a href="https://qgis.org/">QGIS</a> Desktop - Geographical
Information System software.
</p>

<h2>6. Assignments and Assessments</h2>
<p>There are two assignments that are assessed:</p>
<ol>
<li>A portfolio culmination from completing the practical tasks worth 20%.</li>
<li>An independent project worth  80%.</li>
</ol>
