<h1>Python</h1>
<p>Python is a popular and powerful programming language. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely available in source or binary form for all major platforms from the Python web site, <a href="https://www.python.org/">https://www.python.org/</a>, and may be freely distributed. The same site also contains distributions of and pointers to many free third party Python modules, programs and tools, and additional documentation.</p>
<p>Python underwent a major revision from Python 2 to Python 3. Much Python 2 code needed refactoring in order to work in Python 3 environments. It is sensible to know exactly which version of Python you are using and to keep a track of any modifications you have made to your Python environment. This is helpful in science to try to make results more reproducible, but also in programming sometimes you want to ask others for help or to submit a bug report and the helpers or developers will want to replicate the issue.</p>
<p>Computer programming languages are typically evolving over time like software do. Often development teams will support older versions before deprecating or making them obsolete and no longer supporting them. This encourages users to try and use newwer versions which are typically more capable or functional, but not always!</p>
<p>A getting started tutorial is available on the Python web site and this can be find via the following URL: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/">https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/</a>. We will be going through much of the same in this course.</p>
