<h1>Python</h1>
<p>
Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.
</p>
<p>
The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely available in source or binary form for all major platforms from the Python web site, <a href="https://www.python.org/">https://www.python.org/</a>, and may be freely distributed. The same site also contains distributions of and pointers to many free third party Python modules, programs and tools, and additional documentation.
</p>
<p>
Python underwent a major revision from Python 2 to Python 3. It is important to be aware of this and to know exactly what version of Python you are using and about any modifications you have made to your Python environment.
</p>
<p>
A getting started tutorial is available on the Python web site, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/">https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/</a>. This is almost certainly the best place to start if you are a complete beginner and want to learn on your own. If you want to learn with others, there are plenty of courses to choose from. At the University of Leeds there are a number of courses and I currently teach some of them, <a href="https://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/courses/computing/">https://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/courses/computing/</a>.
