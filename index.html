Welcome! I am a research officer based in the School of Geography at the University of Leeds. I teach on courses that introduce R and Python. I mostly program using Java, Maven and Netbeans. I am interested in developing dynamic spatial models and processing geographical data. These Web pages are hosted on GitHub, here is a link to my profile: <a href="http://github.com/agdturner">http://github.com/agdturner</a>.
