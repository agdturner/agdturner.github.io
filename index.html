<p>I am a research officer based in the School of Geography (SoG) at the University of Leeds. I specialise in computational geography. I undertake consultancy and teach.</p>
<p>I mostly program using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)">Java programming language</a> and try to keep up with changes as it evolves. I typically use: the most recent long term support version of the <a href="https://openjdk.org/">OpenJDK</a>; the <a href="https://maven.apache.org/">Apache Maven software project management and comprehension tool</a>; and, the <a href="https://netbeans.apache.org/">Apache NetBeans development environment, tooling platform and application framework</a>.</p>
<p>Professionally, I am interested in: mitigating (fire, flood,  drought, famine, and accident) risks; estimating and measuring costs and benefits; ecology and working with nature; developing dynamic geospatial models and processing geographical data to help mitigate risk; and developing geographical Digital Twins - models of places based on data about them and linked with sensors in the place that are iteratively used to develop a more detailed representation. I am keen to nurture others and work collaboratively.</p>
