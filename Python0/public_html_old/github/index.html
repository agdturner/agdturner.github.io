<H2 id="1">1. Introduction</H2>
<P><a href="C:\Users\geoagdt\src\agdt\agdturner.github.io\Python0\public_html\index/index.html#GitHub">GitHub</a> is a developer platform to build, scale, and deliver secure
software. It is a collaborative platform that is popular and
reliable and provides hosting for basic websites for users,
teams and software.
</P>
<P>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub">
GitHub Wikipedia Article</a> provides a history of GitHub
</P>
<P>If you accept the
<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service">
GitHub Terms of Service</a>, please create an account choosing a
username comprising lower case letters and numbers. You do not
need a GitHub account to complete this course, but it is
recommended.
</P>
</DIV>

<DIV>
<H2 id="2">2. Getting Started with GitHub</H2>
<P>Complete the
<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world">
GitHub Hello World Tutorial</a>.
</P>
<P><a href="C:\Users\geoagdt\src\agdt\agdturner.github.io\Python0\public_html\index/index.html#Git">Git</a> client software is available via 'AppsAnywhere' at the
University of Leeds which is accessible remotely via the
'Academic'
<a href="https://wvd.leeds.ac.uk">
University Windows Virtual Desktop</a>.
Alternatively,
<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git#setting-up-git">
follow these instructions to setup a
<a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">Git Client<a> on your
local machine</a>.
</P>
<P>Complete the
<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo">
GitHub Create a Repository Tutorial</a> and clone the repository
to the local machine you are using by following the
<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository">
GitHub Clone a Repository Tutorial</a>.
</P>
<P>If you have followed correctly, you should now have a
'hello-world' local git repository cloned from a 'hello-world'
remote repository on GitHub.
</P>
<P>Now to practice making changes and keeping things synchronised:
First, make a change in the local hello-world repository, commit
the change, and then push the change to the remote repository on
GitHub:
</P>
<OL>
<LI>Open your local copy of 'README.md' in a text editor, make a
change (for example, add a line of text) and save the file.
</LI>
<LI>Open the git client command line interface and change to the
local repository directory.
</LI>
<LI>Commit the change to the local repository and then push this
change to the remote repository on GitHub using the following
commands:
<PRE>git add .
git commit -m "change this commit message so it is informative"
git push
</PRE></LI>
</OL>
<P>There are alternative ways to do this, but this way is
recommended.
</P>
<P>Now, check on GitHub that the 'README.md' file there is updated.
You may need to reload the page in order to see the change.
</P>
<P>Next, change the file on the remote GitHub repository using the
browser and commit the change there: To edit the README click on
the 'Edit Button' which looks like a pen (in dark mode it looks
like the following where the button is identified with a red
elipse: <img src="../resources/github/edit.png"
alt="GitHub README edit button" />). Once you have finished
editing, action the 'Commit changes' button to save the changes.
</P>
<P>The remote repository is now 'ahead' of the local repository
(which is 'behind'). To synchronize, pull the committed remote
repository changes to the local repository: In the git bash tool
in the repository directory directory enter:
</P>
<PRE>git pull</PRE><P>You should see confirmation of this pulling the remote
repository changes to the local repository.
</P>
<P>There is a lot to GitHub that we are not going to use or learn
about in this course including: forking repositories, creating
branches, creating issues, resolving issues by submitting and
accepting 'pull requests'. These are all commonly taken steps in
collaborating on shared code bases in the GitHub ecosystem which
is typically what a lot of team programming involves.
</P>
<P>Something you may have to learn about is to deal with 'merge
conflicts'. This is when changes have been made to the same file
and in the same places such that the act of sychronizing the
repositories now requires decisions to be made about which
changes to keep. Let us deal with that in an ad hoc manner if
and when it happens.
</P>
<P>One of the main benefits of using git or a similar repository
like system is that all changes are recorded and versioned, so
it is possible to reset to an earlier version should this be
desired, and this takes the difficulty away from doing all this
in a more manual way.
</P>
</DIV>

<DIV>
<H2 id="3">3. Python Code Repository Setup</H2>
<P>Create a new repository on GitHub which will be your code
repository for this course, call it something simple (you can
rename it later), include a README, and in the '.gitignore'
section choose the 'python' option. Spend some time to
<a href="https://choosealicense.com/">choose a license</a> and
select this from the options available. There are a few
different kinds of license. You are advised to choose an open
source license and not write your own from scratch. The license
is a legal document that states terms of use, modification and
redistribution and provides a disclaimer to indemnify you if
something goes wrong.
</P>
<P>Clone your new repository so you have a local repository set
up as was done with the 'hello-world' repository. Create a new
folder/directory in the new repository called 'test'. Start
Spyder; add a python command and save the code in a file in the
newly created 'test' directory. Add and commit changes to the
local repository and push the changes to the remote repository
as was done with the 'hello-world' repository. Check the new
file appears on GitHub.
</P>
<P>Run the new Python file you have created. A directory named
__pycache__ might appear in the test directory. This contains
interpreted files generated by the Python interpreter. The
GitHub '.gitignore' settings for Python will not push this
directory contents to GitHub - which is what is wanted.
</P>
</DIV>

<DIV>
<H2 id="4">4. GitHub Pages</H2>
<P>Create another repository on GitHub - your GitHub Pages
Website. Follow the
<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart">
GitHub Pages Quickstart Tutorial</a>
</P>
</DIV>

<DIV>
<H2 id="5">5. Taking Stock</H2>
<P>The benefits of using GitHub and the command line interface for
git might not yet be clear and this may seem a complicated
distraction, but it is important to be aware of current
programming practice and hopefully you will realise the benefits
during the course as you become more familiar with programming
and using git/GitHub.
</P>
<P>As mentioned, there is a lot more to GitHub than has been
covered here. Practised creating repositories, cloning, pulling,
committing and pushing is something is good for now.
</P>
<P>If you have decided against using GitHub, then consider using
<a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a>;
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/">Sourceforge</a>, or
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/">BitBucket</a> instead.
</P>
<P>If you do not want to use these either, then consider using:
<a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a>,
<a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/">Mercurial</a> or
<a href="http://subversion.apache.org/">Subversion</a> to set up
a local repository.
</P>
<P>As a minimum, please ensure your files are organised, versioned
and backed up.
</P>
