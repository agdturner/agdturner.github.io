<DIV>
<H2 id="1">1. Introduction</H2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming">Computer programming</a> (coding) is the process of designing and building an executable computer program - a set of instruction fetched and executed sequentially.</p>
<p>Contemporary desktop and laptop computers typically have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_keyboard">keyboard</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_mouse">mouse</a> for user input, a visual display screen (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_monitor">monitor</a>), smaller amounts of faster more volatile data storage (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_memory">memory</a>), and larger amounts of more persistent data storage (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_memory">disk</a> that is organised using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system">file system</a>. Computers may have inbuilt or perpherally connected devices such as microphones, cameras, and additional data  storage. The monitor may also be an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchscreen">touchscreen</a> for user input. Networked computers typically communicate using standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet">Internet</a> protocols. The basic functioning of a computer is handled by an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system">operating system</a> upon which additional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software">software</a> can be installed, including software that can interpret more readable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code">source code</a> into lower level less readable machine instructions.</p>
<p>Programming can be done visually by arranging and connecting pre-built components into executable workflows. However, this course is about programming using text based command instructions.</p>
<DIV>
<H2 id="2">2. Data</H2>
<DIV>
<H3 id="2.1">2.1. Bits and Bytes</H3>
<P>In most modern computers, data is encoded in binary: the
smallest unit is a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit">bit</a> which encodes one of two possible states, which - for simplicity
and brevity - are denoted '0' and '1'.
</P>
<P>Typically computers work with fixed size collections of bits
called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte">bytes</a>.</P>
<P>The more bits there are in a byte, the more different unique
combinations or arrangements of bits there can be. With each
added bit, there are double the number of combinations. So, with
2 bits there are 4 possible combinations [00, 01, 10, 11]; with
3 bits there are 8 combinations [000, 001, 010, 100, 011, 101,
110, 111]; with 4, 16 combinations; with 5, 32 combination, and
so on. With each added bit in a byte there are twice as many
combinations compared to the smaller sizes byte. This doubling
adds up exponentially and soon provides many combinations...
</P>
<P>7 bits in a byte allows for (128 combinations) which is
sufficient to represent all the letters in the English alphabet
in both lower and upper case, the ten numeric digits 0 to 9, and
64 other symbols.
</P>
<P>7 bit bytes is the basis of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII">ASCII</a> - a data encoding which is used often used for text, and is the
 basis of a number of different
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_format">file formats</a>.</P>
<P><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode">Unicode</a> is another commonly used encoding. As of Unicode version 15.0,
there are 149,186 characters that are uniquely encoded,
including various alphabets, mathematical symbols and emojis.
Unicode uses between 1 and 4 bytes of length 8 for encoding.
</P>
<P>Commonly, there are multiples of 8 bits in a byte, but there can
be any number.
</P>
<DIV>
<H3 id="2.2">2.2. File Formats</H3>
<P>Data stored in a file is often stored in a standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_format">file format</a> - typically based on a versioned specification which details
the encodings used and how data gets arranged.
</P>
<P>Some file formats use different encodings in different parts, a
complication that makes the data more usable and more compact
- requiring less storage space.
<P>Often the suffix of a filename indicates the file format, for
example the file format of a file named "index.html" is expected
to be
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a>. Some file formats contain an identifying code (known as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_format#Magic_number">magic number</a> typically at the start of the file which specify the format.
File format can also be detailed in external
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata">metadata</a>.</P>
<P>File formats are revisited in
<a href="../io/index.html#5">IO Section 5.</a>
</P>
<DIV>
<H3 id="2.3">2.3. Integers and Floating Point</H3>
<P>All the integer numbers in a specific range are often
represented individually using bytes of a length sufficient for
that range. The encoding will detail how this is done. Usually,
zero is either in the middle or at the start of the range. If
the byte size is minimal, to represent integer numbers in a
wider range, either the byte size must increase, or multiple
bytes must be used in a more complicated encoding.
</P>
<P>Floating point numbers are a subset of fractions typically
encoded using bytes of length 32 or 64. The density of fractions
within any part of the range varies. In general, the density is
greater towards the centre of the range, which with standard
floating point numbers is zero.
</P>
<P><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic">Floating point arithmetic</a> is standardised and the result of a calculation gets rounded to
the nearest value. Most of the time, the standardisation has
ensured that calculations on different computers are the same,
but there can be variation. Anyway, for some floating point
calculations the result is completely accurate and precise,
other times it is rounded either up or down. It is important to
be aware that there can be significant error in this
standardised arithmetic.
<P><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-precision_floating-point_format">Single precision floating point</a> is a standard encoding that uses 32 bit bytes to represent a
subset of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_number">rational numbers</a>.</P>
<P><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format">Double precision floating point</a> is a standard encoding that uses 64 bit bytes to represent a
subset of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_number">rational numbers</a>.</P>
<DIV>
<H2 id="3">3. Learning to Program</H2>
<P>Learning to program takes time and energy. It is highly
recommended that you organise to learn new programming concepts
when you are well rested and have good concentration. Mistakes
and misunderstandings are more likely if you are tired or
distracted.
</P>
<P>Take breaks as you learn. They do more than help avoid fatigue
- they can save a lot more time than they take, and make the
learning experience more healthy and enjoyable.
</P>
<P>Save your work often and use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control">version control</a> as this avoids losing work and provides a track of progress
that you and others might find useful.
</P>
<P>Once you have a good grip of programming basics, (which you
should have after this course), good ways to improve your skills
are by getting involved in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software">open source software</a> development projects, reviewing code, writing code, reading
documentation and doing other programming courses.
</P>
<P>Being familiar with one programming language helps in learning
another. Many concepts are shared and the language syntax and
workflows are often similar.
</P>
<P>Some programming languages are particularly well geared for
particular types of application. This can be a consequence of
the language fundamentals, but often it is because something
similar has already been done with that language.
</P>
<P>When given a choice, experienced programmers will often choose
a language for an implementation because they either know that
language well - and can envisage what to do, or because they
know that a particular language is well suited to the task, or
because they want to learn/try something new/different.
</P>
<P>Programming and programming language development are typically
community activities. It is normal to ask others for help and to
provide others with help and work collaboratively to develop
software. There are various online systems that help with this
including online forums.
</P>
<P>Asking for help with programming is a skill. Whilst it may be
easiest for you to show someone what is happening and talk about
it. It is often not so easy to arrange an interactive help
session. Often the best way to get help is to document the issue
- describe and detail with text and pictures what is happeneing
and why this is confusing or not what you expect/want to happen.
Often the act of describing and detailing the issue can help with
understanding and trying different things which may ultimately
resolve the issue before you ask for help. Don't see this as
wasted effort, the more you practise preparing to ask for help,
the better you should be at it when you do!
</P>
<P>Often detailing an issue involves consulting documentation
and providing information about your environment. Sometimes the
issue is not that you have done something wrong, but that some
other code or software is not working as it should, or that the
way that things are set up to work is somehow causing the issue.
</P>
<P>Sometimes the issue is a result of a '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug">software bug</a>' - an error, flaw or fault in the design, development, or
operation that causes incorrect or unexpected things to happen.
Sometimes issues happen in the same way each time something is
attempted, other times the fault only sometimes happens. A
fault that only sometimes happens is known as a '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glitch">glitch</a>' and these can be difficult to troubleshoot.</P>
<P>Often it is worth restarting software or rebooting the
operating system to attempt to stop unexpected behaviour
happening. If you start having to do this frequently it becomes
more of a pain, so that you either want a better work around, or
for the bug to get fixed.
</P>
<P>Reporting a bug is an important activity in software and
language development. Many bug reports are made openly
available. A 'known bug' is one that has been reported already.
This may already be being worked on or be 'resolved' or 'fixed'
or there may be 'workarounds' - ways of coping.
</P>
<P>A new version of software is typically released with one or
more bug fixes. Sometimes you have to decide when it is worth
doing the work to change to this later version or whether you
can cope with a workaround.
</P>
<P>Whether you are filing a bug report, or just asking for help,
often you should aim to provide a minimum working example to
replicate the bug/issue. And as with all data exchanges, you
should think carefully before sharing data.
</P>
<P>In learning to program, some things you might comprehend
instantly, other things might take several attempts to grasp or
fully understand. Some things you might understand, but they
seem strange. Usually, there is a good reason why something
works and is written the way it is, but no language is perfect
and there may well be a better way...
</P>
<DIV>
<H2 id="4">4. Language Evolution, Deprecation and Versions</H2>
<P>High level computer programming languages like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)">Java</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)">Python</a> can evolve rapidly. Occasionally new languages are developed.
Some programming languages are retired or become obsolete, and
some older versions of languages become unsupported over time.
The release cadence is how often releases are made. Sometimes
releases are of different kinds which are supported for
different periods.
</P>
<P>Supporting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_compatibility">backward compatibility</a> - interoperability with older versions - has both costs and
benefits. These costs and benefits are weighed up by those
developing languages that tyically have a process of deciding
how things change.
</P>
<P>Changes that are not backward compatible can create a lot of
work! It is also discouraging if old code does not work with
newer language interpreters as this results in reliance on old
versions which can be problematic and have cyber security
implications.
</P>
<P>Languages compete for users and developers. Often new features
in one language are implemented in other languages soon after.
The pace of language evolution is related to the scale of
investment in resources, and the skill, and design decisions
taken by the developer community.
</P>
<P>As new syntax, new functionality and more efficient ways of
doing things evolve in a language, some code either becomes
obsolete, or is best changed to use the new ways. This can
require considerable effort to retire or update (refactor) code.
</P>
<P>Fundamental changes in language syntax are associated with
major new versions of a language. Minor versions may add new
language features. Minor-minor version changes are usually
associated with one or more bug fix.
</P>
<P><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deprecation">Deprecation</a> is a common part of modern high level languages and third party
software. It is part of a process of phasing things out. Things
are first marked as deprecated in a version, then in subsequent
versions the things are removed.
