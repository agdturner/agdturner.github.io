<DIV>
<H2 id="1">1. Introduction</H2>
<P><a href="../index/index.html#Computer programming">Computer programming</a> is the process of developing and running <a href="../index/index.html#Computer program">computer programs</a>, and is often abbreviated to 'programming' and sometimes
referred to as 'coding' (although coding is perhaps a more
general term). Computer progams are often referred to as
'programs' or '<a href="../index/index.html#Executable">executables</a>' or '<a href="../index/index.html#Software">software</a>'. Programs run in an <a href="../index/index.html#Operating System">operating system</a> environment on computational <a href="../index/index.html#Computer hardware">hardware</a>.</P>
<P>A contemporary general-purpose computer is sometimes called a
workstation, desktop or laptop. These typically have a
<a href="../index/index.html#Keyboard">keyboard</a> and <a href="../index/index.html#Mouse">mouse</a> for user input, a visual display screen (<a href="../index/index.html#Monitor">monitor</a>), smaller amounts of faster more volatile data storage (<a href="../index/index.html#Memory">memory</a>), and larger amounts of more persistent data storage (<a href="../index/index.html#Disk storage">disk</a>) that is organised using a <a href="../index/index.html#File System">file system</a>. Such computers may have other inbuilt or perpherally
connected devices such as
<a href="../index/index.html#Microphone">microphones</a>, <a href="../index/index.html#Speakers">speakers</a>, <a href="../index/index.html#Camera">cameras</a>, and additional <a href="../index/index.html#Computer data storage">data storage</a>. The monitor may also be a <a href="../index/index.html#Touchscreen">touchscreen</a> user interface.</P>
<P>The basic functioning of a <a href="../index/index.html#Computer">computer</a> is handled by the <a href="../index/index.html#Operating System">operating system</a> upon which additional <a href="../index/index.html#Software">software</a> can be installed for programming, including  <a href="../index/index.html#Compiler">compilers</a> and <a href="../index/index.html#Interpreter">interpreters</a> that convert more readable <a href="../index/index.html#Source code">source code</a> into <a href="../index/index.html#Machine code">machine code</a> <a href="../index/index.html#Instruction">instructions</a> executed by <a href="../index/index.html#Processor">processors</a>. Contemporary general-purpose workstations are typically
multi-core - in that they contain multiple processors.
</P>
<P>Networked computers typically communicate using standard
<a href="../index/index.html#Internet">Internet</a> protocols and can be organised to work together. Whilst
networked general purpose computers collectively have a lot of
power. It is not easy to utilise this power efficiently, so
research facilities often make available
<a href="../index/index.html#Supercomputer">Supercomputers</a> for <a href="../index/index.html#High Performance Computing">High Performance Computing</a>.</P>

<DIV>
<H2 id="2">2. Data</H2>

<DIV>
<H3 id="2.1">2.1. Bits and Bytes</H3>
<P>In most modern computers, data is encoded in binary: the
smallest unit is a
<a href="../index/index.html#Bit">bit</a> which encodes two possible states, denoted
<CODE>0</CODE> and <CODE>1</CODE>.</P>
<P>Typically computers work with fixed size collections of bits
called
<a href="../index/index.html#Byte">bytes</a>.</P>
<P>The more bits there are in a byte, the more different unique
combinations or arrangements of bits there can be. With each
added bit, there are double the number of combinations. So,
with 2 bits there are 4 possible combinations -
<CODE>[00, 01, 10, 11]</CODE>; with 3 bits there are 8 possible combinations - <CODE>[000, 001, 010, 100, 011, 101, 110, 111] </CODE>, and so on. With each added bit in a byte there are twice as
many combinations, soon provides many combinations...
</P>
<P>7 bits in a byte allows for (128 combinations) which is
sufficient to represent all the letters in the English
alphabet in both lower and upper case, the ten numeric digits
0 to 9, and 64 other symbols.</P>
<P>Commonly, there are multiples of 8 bits in a byte, but there
can be any number.
</P>

<DIV>
<H3 id="2.2">2.2. File Formats</H3>
<P>Data stored in the <a href="../index/index.html#File System">file system</a> is often encoded using a standard <a href="../index/index.html#File format">file format</a> - a specification which details the encodings used and how
data are arranged.
</P>
<P>Text is commonly encoded as <a href="../index/index.html#ASCII">ASCII</a> or <a href="../index/index.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>. (ASCII encoding uses 7 bit bytes. Unicode uses between
1 and 4 bytes of length 8 for encoding. As of Unicode verson
15.0, there are 149,186 characters that are uniquely encoded,
including various alphabets, mathematical symbols and emojis.)</P>
<P>Some file formats use different encodings in different parts,
a complication that can make the data more usable and more
compact.
</P>
<P>Often the suffix of a filename indicates the file format, for
example the file format of a file with a name ending ".html"
is expected to be in
<a href="../index/index.html#HTML">HTML</a>format. Some file formats contain an identifying code (known as a <a href="../index/index.html#Magic Number">magic number</a> (typically at the start of the file) which specifies the
format. The file format can also be detailed in external
<a href="../index/index.html#Metadata">metadata</a>.</P>
<P>File formats are revisited in
<a href="../io/index.html#5">IO Section 5.</a>
</P>

<DIV>
<H3 id="2.3">2.3. Integers and Floating Point</H3>
<P>All the <a href="../index/index.html#Integer">integer</a> numbers in a specific range are often represented
individually using
<a href="../index/index.html#Byte">bytes</a> of a length sufficient for that range. An encoding will
detail how this is done. Often, zero is either in the middle
or at the start of the range. If the byte size is minimal, to
represent integer numbers in a wider range, either the byte
size must increase, or multiple bytes must be used in a more
complicated encoding.
</P>
<P>Floating point numbers are a subset of <a href="../index/index.html#Rational number">rational numbers</a> often encoded using bytes of length 32 or 64. <a href="../index/index.html#Single-precision floating-point">Single precision</a> is a standard encoding that uses 32 bit bytes. <a href="../index/index.html#Double-precision floating-point">Double precision</a> is a standard encoding that uses 64 bit bytes. The number of
rational numbers within any part of the range varies.
</P>
<P><a href="../index/index.html#Floating point arithmetic">Floating point arithmetic</a> is standardised. The result of a calculation gets rounded to
the nearest value that can be represented in the encoding.
Most of the time, the standardisation results in the same
calculations on different computers, but there can be rounding
variations. Anyway, for some arithmetic calculations the result
is completely accurate and precise, for others the result cannot
be stored exactly in the encoding and is effectively rounded
either up or down.
</P>

<DIV>
<H2 id="3">3. Learning to Program</H2>
<P>Learning to program takes time and energy. It is highly
recommended that you organise to learn programming concepts
when you are well rested, have good concentration and can work
without distraction.
</P>
<P>Take breaks as you learn. They help you learn, avoid fatigue, be
efficient, and should make the learning experience healthier and
more enjoyable.
</P>
<P>Save your work often and use <a href="../index/index.html#Version control">version control</a> as approriate to avoid losing work and to help you and other
track progress.
</P>
<P>Good ways to improve your skills are by getting involved in
<a href="../index/index.html#Open Source Software">open source software</a> development projects, reviewing code, writing code, reading
documentation and doing other programming courses.
</P>
<P>Being familiar with one programming language helps in learning
another. Many concepts are shared and language syntax and
programming workflows are often similar.
</P>
<P>Programming and programming language development are typically
community activities. It is normal to ask others for help and
to provide others with help and work collaboratively to
develop software. There are various online systems that help
with this including online forums.
</P>
<P>Asking for help with programming is a skill in itself. Whilst it
may seem easiest for you to show someone what is happening and
talk to someone else about it. It is often not so easy to
arrange an interactive help session. Often the best way to get
help is to document the issue - describe and explain with text
and pictures what you are trying to do, what happens, and why
this is confusing or not what you expect/want to happen. Often
documenting the issue can help you better understand and come
up with ideas of different things to try, which may ultimately
resolve the issue before you ask for help. Don't see this as
wasted effort, the more you practise preparing to ask for
help, the better you should be at it when you do! Such prompting
is also the basis of
<a href="../index/index.html#Vibe Programming">Vibe Programming</a> where developers use <a href="../index/index.html#Artificial Intelligence">AI</a> assistance to generate, <a href="../index/index.html#Code refactoring">refactor</a>, <a href="../index/index.html#Debugging">debug</a>, test and document code.</P>
<P>Often detailing an issue involves consulting documentation
and providing information about your environment. Sometimes
the issue is not that you have done something wrong, but that
some other code or software is not working as it should, or
that the way that things are set up to work is somehow causing
the issue.
</P>
<P>Sometimes the issue is a result of a '<a href="../index/index.html#Software bug">software bug</a>' - an error, flaw or fault in the design, development, or
operation that causes incorrect or unexpected things to
happen. Sometimes issues happen in the same way each time
something is attempted, other times the fault only sometimes
happens. A fault that only sometimes happens is known as a '<a href="../index/index.html#Glitch">glitch</a>' and these can be difficult to troubleshoot.</P>
<P>Often it is worth restarting software or rebooting the
computer
<a href="../index/index.html#Operating System">operating system</a> to attempt to stop unexpected behaviour happening. Having to
do this frequently becomes annoying, and it can be worth
spending time trying to get a better workaround in place, or
to report and help fix the bug.
</P>
<P>Reporting a bug is an important activity in software and
language development. Many bug reports are made openly
available. A 'known bug' is one that has been reported
already. This may already be being worked on or be 'resolved'
or 'fixed' or there may be 'workarounds' - ways of coping.
</P>
<P>A new version of software is typically released with one or
more bug fixes. Sometimes you have to decide when it is worth
doing the work to change to this later version or whether you
can cope with a workaround.
</P>
<P>Whether you are filing a bug report, or just asking for help,
often you should aim to provide a minimum working example to
replicate the bug/issue. And as with all data exchanges, you
should think carefully before sharing data.
</P>
<P>In learning to program, some things you might comprehend
instantly, other things might take several attempts to grasp or
fully understand. Some things you might understand, but they
seem strange. Usually, there is a good reason why something
works and is written the way it is, but no language is perfect
and there may well be a better way...
</P>

<DIV>
<H2 id="4">4. Language Evolution, Deprecation and Versions</H2>
<P>High level computer programming languages like <a href="../index/index.html#Java">Java</a> and <a href="../index/index.html#Python">Python</a> can evolve rapidly. Occasionally new languages are developed.
Some programming languages are retired or become obsolete, and
some older versions of languages become unsupported over time.
The release cadence is how often releases are made. Sometimes
releases are of different kinds which are supported for
different periods.
</P>
<P>Supporting <a href="../index/index.html#Backward compatibility">backward compatibility</a> - interoperability with older versions - has both costs and
benefits. These costs and benefits are weighed up by those
developing languages that tyically have a process of deciding
how things change.
</P>
<P>Changes that are not backward compatible can create a lot of
work! It is also discouraging if old code does not work with
newer language interpreters as this results in reliance on old
versions which can be problematic and have cyber security
implications.
</P>
<P>Languages compete for users and developers. Often new features
in one language are implemented in other languages soon after.
The pace of language evolution is related to the scale of
investment in resources, and the skill, and design decisions
taken by the developer community.
</P>
<P>As new syntax, new functionality and more efficient ways of
doing things evolve in a language, some code either becomes
obsolete, or is best changed to use the new ways. This can
require considerable effort to retire or update (refactor) code.
</P>
<P>Fundamental changes in language syntax are associated with
major new versions of a language. Minor versions may add new
language features. Minor-minor version changes are usually
associated with one or more bug fix.
</P>
<P><a href="../index/index.html#Deprecation">Deprecation</a> is a common part of modern high level languages and third party
software. It is part of a process of phasing things out. Things
are first marked as deprecated in a version, then in subsequent
versions the things are removed.
