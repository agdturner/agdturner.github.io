</PRE><P>And this plot:</P>
<P><img src="../../resources/abm2/Figure_1.png" alt="ABM2 Output Plot" />
</P>
<P>Some of the print statements in the code presented above have
been 'commented out' - turned into comments. This reduces the
amount of text output. Most of the print statements were for
testing, but might be worth keeping in place for the time being.
Printing out a lot of information to the console can be slow and
unhelpful. Generally, it is a lot faster to write to a file.
</P>
<P>The text output gives the agent coordinates before and then
after a single move. This could be clearer in the information
printed out, but the output is fine for the time being.
</P>
<P>In your local code repository src directory create a new
directory called "abm3". Open Spyder and use "save as" to save
your "model.py" file into the abm3 directory.
</P>
</DIV>


<DIV>
<H2 id="2">2. Distance Calculations</H2>

<DIV>
<H3 id="2.1">2.1. Define a Function</H3>
<P>Change the distance calculation code into a function named
'get_distance': Use the 'def' keyword and specify four input
parameters (x0, y0, x1, y1). Recall that a function declaration
ends with a colon ':', and the code of the function must be
indented. Return the distance calculated as the last statement
of the function using the keyword 'return' followed by the name
of the variable that is the calculated distance. After the
function write a statement to call it and print out the distance
returned.
</P>
<P>Run the code to test it works</P>
<P>If your code calculates the square root in two ways, then
simplify it by removing one of these ways. Consider simplifying
your code in other ways too...
</P>
<P><p>Change the comment that describes the function into a <a href="../index/index.html#Python_docstring">docstring</a> clarifying what the function inputs and outputs are.</P>

<DIV>
<H3 id="2.2">2.2. Calculate the maximum distance</H3>
<P>Imagine a two dimensional matrix with the agents aligned in the
same sequence along each dimension and the distances between
them being the values in the matrix. The matrix is symmetrical
about a diagonal where all the distances are zero.
</P>
<P>The maximum distance between any two agents is the maximum
distance in this matrix, indeed it is the maximum distance in
one half of the values not on the zero diagonal. Anyway, a pair
of nested
<a href="../index/index.html#Python_for">for loops</a> can be used to calculate it: An outer loop that iterates over
all agents; and an inner loop that iterates over all agents.
Within the inner loop the get_distance function can be used to
calculate the distance between a pair of agents (one from the
outer loop and one from the inner loop), and the
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#max">
builtin max function</a> can be used to calculate the maximum
distance encountered yet. The following code does this:
</P>
<PRE><CODE class="language-python">max_distance = 0 # Initialise max_distance
for a in agents:
    for b in agents:
        distance = get_distance(a[0], a[1], b[0], b[1])
        print("distance between", a, b, distance)
        max_distance = max(max_distance, distance)
        print("max_distance", max_distance)
</CODE></PRE>

<P>Add the code to the end of your program, run it and examine the
output. In calculating the maximum distance, you should see
that some zero distances are calculated. These will either be
where an agent is located at the same place as another agent, or
where the calculation is for the same agent - the diagonals in
the imaginary matrix.
</P>
<P>Recall that there are two main ways to iterate over the items in
a list. As above, and alternatively using list indexes. The
following code does the same calculation, and uses the
<a href="../index/index.html#Python_range">range function</a> to get a sequence of indexes:</P>
<PRE><CODE class="language-python">max_distance = 0
for i in range(len(agents)):
    a = agents[i]
    for j in range(len(agents)):
        b = agents[j]
        distance = get_distance(a[0], a[1], b[0], b[1])
        print("distance between", a, b, distance)
        max_distance = max(max_distance, distance)
        print("max_distance", max_distance)
</CODE></PRE>

<P>Note that this code uses variables 'i' and 'j' for the indexes,
and the
<a href="../index/index.html#Python_len">len function</a>to get the length of the agents list. (Here, 'len(agents)' is
the same as 'n_agents', which could be used instead (and would
be more efficient). Change this if you want, but consider what
would happen if the length of the agents list gets changed in
the model.)
</P>
<P>Write a function called 'get_max_distance' that returns the
maximum distance between all the agents.
</P>
<P>Your 'get_distance' function should look something like:</P>
<PRE><CODE class="language-python">def get_distance(x0, y0, x1, y1):
    """
    Calculate the Euclidean distance between (x0, y0) and (x1, y1).

    Parameters
    ----------
    x0 : Number
        The x-coordinate of the first coordinate pair.
    y0 : Number
        The y-coordinate of the first coordinate pair.
    x1 : Number
        The x-coordinate of the second coordinate pair.
    y1 : Number
        The y-coordinate of the second coordinate pair.

    Returns
    -------
    distance : Number
        The Euclidean distance between (x0, y0) and (x1, y1).
    """
    # Calculate the difference in the x coordinates.
    dx = x0 - x1
    # Calculate the difference in the y coordinates.
    dy = y0 - y1
    # Return the Sum the squared differences square rooted.
    return ((dx * dx) + (dy * dy)) ** 0.5
</CODE></PRE>

<P>Use your 'get_max_distance' function to calculate the maximum
distance between all the agents just after they have been
initialised.
</P>
<P>If a <a href="../index/index.html#Python_NameError">NameError</a>is raised indicating that 'get_max_distance' is not defined,
then recall that the Python interpreter needs to have read a
function definition before it can be called. So, rearrange your
code so that the function is defined before it is called.
</P>
</DIV>


<DIV>
<H2 id="3">3. Timing</H2>
<P>This section is about using the <a href="../index/index.html#Python_time">time module</a> to report timings and explore code efficiency.</P>
<P>Save your source code file with a new name, for example
"timing.py".
</P>
<P>Add the following import statement along with the others
towards the top of the source code:
</P>
<PRE><CODE class="language-python">import time</CODE></PRE>

<P>Before calculating the maximum distance between the initialised
agents add the following line:
</P>
<PRE><CODE class="language-python">start = time.perf_counter()</CODE></PRE>

<P>This sets the variable 'start' to a time variable which is the
number of second since the computer was last rebooted. After
calculating the maximum distance add the following code to
calculate and report a time interval:
</P>
<PRE><CODE class="language-python">end = time.perf_counter()
print("Time taken to calculate maximum distance", end - start,
"seconds")
</CODE></PRE>

<P>Run your program and check the time taken to calculate maximum
distance. (It could report '0.0' seconds for 10 agents. This
does not mean that the processing took no time, but that it was
very quick and closer to zero milliseconds than one.)
</P>
<P>The plan in this part is to explore the following two things:
</P>
<OL>
<LI>How does the processing time scale as 'n_agents' increases?</LI>
<LI>Other potentially more optimal ways of calculating the maximum
distance between agents.
</LI>
</OL>
<P>Increase 'n_agents' to 500 and run the program again. Notice
that the plotting is a little delayed and printing out the
agents now clutters the text output.
</P>
<P>As printing and plotting are slow and can effect timings
significantly, comment out the code for printing agents and the
code for plotting agents.
</P>
<P>Run your program again. It should now be easy to see the time
taken to calculate the maximum distance between agents, which is
expected to take a fraction of a second.
</P>
<P>  Run again and compare the timing. It is normal for the timing
  to vary slightly from one run to another. The amount of
  computation is the same, but the exact timing depends on other
  things that are hard to control for - such as how busy the
  computer is doing other things.
</P>
<P>Adapt your code:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Create a loop to run for a range of n_agents.</LI>
<LI>Create a list to store timing results.</LI>
<LI>Create a plot with time on one axis and n_agents on the other.
</LI>
</OL>
<P>Experiment with your range function to get an interesting plot.
</P>
<P>Spend at least 15 minutes trying to do this coding. If you
manage to do it within this time, then great, if not, then don't
worry. Having tried, compare your efforts with
<a href="../../resources/abm3/timing1.py">this solution</a> that
produces the following results:

</PRE><P><img src="../../resources/abm3/Figure_1.png"
alt="A graph of time (y axis) and n_agents (x axis)" />
</P>
<P>Attempt to optimise the calculation of the maximum distance
between all the agents as follows: Modify your code so that
'n_agents = 3', and add the following print statement to the
inner loop of the 'get_max_distance' function:
</P>
<PRE>print("i", i, "j", j)
</PRE><P>Run the code and you should see the following printed in the
text output:
</P>
<PRE>i 0 j 0
i 0 j 1
i 0 j 2
i 1 j 0
i 1 j 1
i 1 j 2
i 2 j 0
i 2 j 1
i 2 j 2
</PRE><P>Change what is in the inner loop of the 'get_max_distance'
function to be within an
<a href="../index/index.html#Python_if">if statement</a>that is only run when 'i' does not equal 'j' using the operator
'!='. The 'if statement' will look like:
</P>
<PRE><CODE class="language-python">if i != j:
</CODE></PRE>

<P>Run the program again and you should see the following in the
console output:
</P>
<PRE>i 0 j 1
i 0 j 2
i 1 j 0
i 1 j 2
i 2 j 0
i 2 j 1
</PRE><P>Compare this output with the previous run output: There is less
output, as when the indexes are the same, the calculations are
skipped.
</P>
<P>Comment out the print statement and run the code for
'n_agents = 1000'. Compare the processing time with/without the
'if statement'.
</P>
<P>The timing is probably about the same and may be more with the
if statement, because the 'if statement' condition is evaluated
every iteration of the inner loop and only filters out the need
for calculation of the n_agents distances that are along the
zero diagonal of the imaginary distance matrix.
</P>
<P>Modify the code again so that: 'n_agents = 3'; the print
statement that was commented out is no longer commented out;
and, so that the operator in the 'if statement' is a '&lt;'):
</P>
<PRE><CODE class="language-python">if i < j:</CODE></PRE>

<P>Run the program again and you should get the following output:
</P>
<PRE>i 0 j 1
i 0 j 2
i 1 j 2
</PRE><P>Understand that the maximum distance can be calculated by
finding the maximum distance between the coordinates as indexed.
It may help you appreciate this if you run for 'n_agents = 5' or
'n_agents = 10' and analyse the output.
</P>
<P>Comment out the print statement again and record timings again
for 'n_agents = 1000'. You should get the same max_distance
result calculated previously, but the processing time should be
roughly half.
</P>
<P>An even faster way involves modifying the loops and removing
the 'if statement'. Can you work out how to do it? (Hint: Change
the range function of the inner for loop to start at index i +
1).
</P>
<P>Once you've given this a try, compare your answer with
<a href="../../resources/abm3/timing2.py">this one</a> in which
the code has been simplified a little and the following graph of
results was obtained:

alt="Another graph of time (y axis) and n_agents (x axis)" />
</P>
</DIV>


<DIV>
<H2 id="4">4. Other distance statistics</H2>
<P>In calculating the maximum distance, a lower bound of 0 was
used to initialise the max_distance variable. To calculate the
minimum distance, then either an upper bound is wanted, or the
initial minimum distance should be set to be a distance between
any two different agents. The upper bound of the distance
between two agents in Euclidean space is theoretically
infinite.
</P>
<P>From the <a href="../index/index.html#Python_math">math module</a> the following can be used for positive infinity:</P>
<PRE><CODE class="language-python">math.inf
</CODE></PRE>

<P>Write a function that calculates the minumum distance between
all the agents and record timings of how long it takes to
calculate both the maximum and minimum distances using the two
different functions.
</P>
<P>Develop a function that calculates both the minimum and
maximum distances using a single set of nested loops and returns
the result in a tuple. You should find that it is significantly
quicker to calculate both the maximum and minimum this way
rather than looping through things and calculating the distances
twice. Write a brief document about the timings to show that
calculating both the minimum and maximum distances using a
single set of nested loops is more efficient. Commit this
document to your repository along with your code.
</P>
<P>As well as the maximum and minimum distance, you might want to
calculate other statistics, such as the average distance.
</P>
<P>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean">arithmetic mean</a>
average can be calculated with one run through the data. To
calculate the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation">standard deviation</a>
of distances, it is first necessary to know the arithmetic mean.
So, it is necessary in calculating the standard deviation to
iterate over the data values at least twice, once to calculate the
mean and again to sum some difference of values from the mean. The
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median">median</a>
and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_(statistics)">mode</a>
could be calculated with a single run through the data. For
calculating the median the data needs to be sorted. Calculating
the mode of a continuous variable is often not useful. Anyway, for
a mode calculation, a dictionary can be used to store a count for
each value and then return the value for which the count is
highest.
</P>
<P>Practising calculating such summary statistics from first
principles is a good way to develop programming skills, so if
you want the extra practise then have a go. Perhaps try
calculating a truncated mean of distances ignoring a proportion
of the highest and lowest distances. Think about how you would
test to ensure your code produces correct results.
</P>
<P>Replace the get_max_distance() in model.py with the new faster
version you have developed.
</P>
<P>Add and commit to your local git repository and assuming you are
using GitHub - push your changes to GitHub.
</P>
</DIV>


<DIV>
<H2 id="5">5. Movement</H2>
<P>Currently, in 'model.py' agents move once. The code will now be
changed to move them a number of times. After initialising
'n_agents', initialise a variable called 'n_iterations' and set
it equal to 1000.
</P>
<P>Create a new outer <a href="../index/index.html#Python_for">for loop</a>to loop through moving agents n_iteration times. An outer loop
is wanted rather than an inner loop as in each iteration agents
are to move in turn rather than each agent taking all their
turns before any others. This outer loop is the 'main simulation
loop'. Add a comment to identify it as such.
</P>
<P>The agents move randomly, and the more of them there are, the
more spread out they are likely to become.
</P>
<P>Edge effects are important to consider in geographical data
analysis and modelling. The agents currently have a
theoretically infinite two dimensional (2D) area to move in. To
make things more manageable, movement will be restricted to a
rectangular area by limiting the x and y coordinates using the
following code blocks:
</P>
<PRE><CODE class="language-python"># Variables for constraining movement.
# The minimum x coordinate.
x_min = 0
# The minimum y coordinate.
y_min = 0
# The maximum x coordinate.
x_max = 99
# The maximum y coordinate.
y_max = 99
</CODE></PRE>

<PRE><CODE class="language-python"># Apply movement constraints.
if agents[i][0] < x_min:
    agents[i][0] = x_min
if agents[i][1] < y_min:
    agents[i][1] = y_min
if agents[i][0] > x_max:
    agents[i][0] = x_max
if agents[i][1] > y_max:
    agents[i][1] = y_max
</CODE></PRE>

<P>Insert the first code block at the top of 'model.py' with
the other initialised variables. Insert the other code block as
part of moving each agent.
</P>
<P>After having moved each agent, the code could loop through the
agents again to constrain movement, but this would be less
efficient than constraining within same loop as moving each
agent.
</P>
<P>Add and commit to your local git repository and assuming you are
using GitHub - push your changes to GitHub.
