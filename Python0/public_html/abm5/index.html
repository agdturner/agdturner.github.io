<DIV>
<H2 id="1">1. Introduction and Preparation</H2>
<P>In this part the ABM environment entity will be initialise from
a file. The agents will interact with this environment in a
simplistic way, and an output file will be generated.
</P>
<P>In your local code repository src directory create a new
directory called 'abm5'. Open Spyder and save 'model.py' and
'agentframework.py' into the 'abm5' directory. Create a new
directory at the same level as your 'src' directory called
'data' and within this create new directories called 'input' and
'output'. These directories will be used to store the model
data. It is good practice to store program data and program
source code in different directories.
</P>
</DIV>

<DIV>
<H2 id="2">2. Input Data</H2>
<P>Download/save into your newly created input data directory the
text file:
<a href="../../resources/abm5/in.txt">in.txt</a>
</P>
<P>Open the file in a text editor. Note that the file comprises
lines of integer numbers delimited by commas. It is a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV</a> format file. It is rectangular, indeed square and has 300 lines
each with 300 values.
</P>
<P>Create a new source code file named 'io.py' in the 'abm5'
directory, add the following lines:
</P>
<pre><code class="language-python">
import csv

# Read input data
f = open('../../data/input/in.txt', newline='')
data = []
for line in csv.reader(f, quoting=csv.QUOTE_NONNUMERIC):
    row = []
    for value in line:
        row.append(value)
        #print(value)
    data.append(row)
f.close()
print(data)
</code></pre><P>Run this new file. The output should correspond to the input
data file only the values are presented with '.0' appended (as
they have been loaded as Float and not Integer numbers).
</P>
<P>Note that the data variable is a list of lists. Essentially
the list is the rows of data and the lists contain the values in
the columns for each row.
</P>
<P>Change the code block into a function called 'read_data' that
returns the data variable. Write code to call this function from
'model.py' by adding the following import statement:
</P>
<pre><code class="language-python">
import io</code></pre><P>After the import statements try to call the 'read_data' function
using:
</P>
<pre><code class="language-python">
environment = io.read_data()</code></pre><P>You should encounter an AttributeError along the lines of the
following:
</P>
<PRE>Traceback (most recent call last):

File "\src\abm5\model.py", line 19, in <module>
  environment = io.read_data('../../data/input/in.txt')

AttributeError: module 'io' has no attribute 'read_data'
</PRE>
<P>This is somewhat confusing as the new 'io' module has a
function called 'read_data'! The exception is raised because
there is a name collision. There is an 'io' standard library
module which does not have an attribute named 'read_data'. It is
the standard library module called 'io' that is being imported!
</P>
<P>Either the non-standard library 'io' module needs to be
renamed, or it needs to be packaged - which involves creating a
directory and moving 'io.py' into it. Packaging is the
recommended way forward. In the 'abm5' directory, create a
directory called 'my_modules' and move both 'io.py' and
'agentframework.py' into it. Change the respective import
statements in 'model.py' to be:
</P>
<pre><code class="language-python">
import my_modules.agentframework as af
import my_modules.io as io
</code></pre><P>Run 'model.py' and it should now run without the error. (If you
still get an error then restart Spyder.)
</P>
<P>Change the 'read_data' function so it checks that each row of
'data' contains the same number of values. Also change the
function so it returns the number of lines (n_rows) and the
number of values in each line (n_cols) as well as 'data'.
(Hint, pack these in a
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#tuples">tuple</a>, and unpack the returned tuple in the code that calls the
function initialising variables 'n_rows' and 'n_cols' as
well as 'environment'.)
</P>
</DIV>

<DIV>
<H2 id="3">3. Plot environment</H2>
<P>Assume that each row of 'environment' aligns with a y-coordinate
and each column of 'environment' aligns with an x-coordinate.
</P>
<P>To plot 'agents' on the 'environment' add the following at the
start of the plotting section:
</P>
<pre><code class="language-python">
plt.imshow(environment)</code></pre><P>Change the initialisation of 'x_max' and 'y_max' to be as
follows:
</P>
<pre><code class="language-python">
# The maximum an agents x coordinate is allowed to be.
x_max = n_cols - 1
# The maximum an agents y coordinate is allowed to be.
y_max = n_rows - 1
</code></pre><P>A plot should be produced that looks like:</P>
<P><img src="../../resources/abm5/Figure_1.png"
alt="A plot of agents on the environment." />
</P>
<P>The pattern of agent locations is the same, although the plot
y-axis has flipped and the x-axis and y-axis now have the same
increments, so the the pattern is more squashed along the
x-axis. Limit the plot axes and flip the y-axis back by adding
the following code before the plot.show() function is called:
</P>
<pre><code class="language-python">
plt.ylim(y_min, y_max)
plt.xlim(x_min, x_max)
</code></pre><P>Run again and the output plot should look like:
<img src="../../resources/abm5/Figure_2.png"
alt="A plot of agents on a limited part of the environment." />
</P>
<P>Currently, the agents are being initialised in a corner of the
environment. Change the code so that they are initialised in the
middle. A good way to do this is to pass in 'n_rows' and
'n_cols' to the Agent '__init__' constructor method, and use
these parameters to initialise the x and y coordinates as
follows:
</P>
<pre><code class="language-python">
def __init__(self, i, n_rows, n_cols):
    """
    The constructor method.

    Parameters
    ----------
    i : Integer
        To be unique to each instance.
    n_rows : Integer
        The number of rows in environment.
    n_cols : Integer
        The number of columns in environment.
    Returns
    -------
    None.
    """
    self.i = i
    tnc = int(n_cols / 3)
    self.x = random.randint(tnc - 1, (2 * tnc) - 1)
    tnr = int(n_rows / 3)
    self.y = random.randint(tnr - 1, (2 * tnr) - 1)
</code></pre><P>Change the code that calls the constuctor method so it passes
in the variables 'n_rows' and 'ncols' approprately. Run
'model.py'. The output plot should look like the following:
<img src="../../resources/abm5/Figure_3.png"
alt="A plot of agents on the environment in the middle." />
</P>
<P>Note that although the random seed has not changed, the pattern
of agent locations is different. This is because the calls to
'random.randint' are different and produce different
coordinates. The pattern could have been kept the same if 100
was added to the output of the 'random.randint' calls as they
were. The following code would do this and effectively
initialise agents in the central third of a similar rectangular
environment irrespective of the number of rows and columns:
</P>
<pre><code class="language-python">
tnc = int(n_cols / 3)
self.x = random.randint(0, tnc - 1) + tnc
tnr = int(n_rows / 3)
self.y = random.randint(0, tnr - 1) + tnr
</code></pre></DIV>

<DIV>
<H2 id="4">4. Agent-Environment Interaction</H2>
<P>Imagine that 'environment' values represent resources that
can be eaten or stored by agents.
</P>
<P>Change the constructor method of the Agent class again so that
'environment' is also expected to be passed in and keep a
reference to this as a class attribute. Also create a 'store'
attribute and set this equal to zero:
</P>
<pre><code class="language-python">
def __init__(self, i, environment, n_rows, n_cols):
"""
The constructor method.

Parameters
----------
i : Integer
    To be unique to each instance.
environment : List
    A reference to a shared environment
n_rows : Integer
    The number of rows in environment.
n_cols : Integer
    The number of columns in environment.

Returns
-------
None.

"""
self.i = i
self.environment = environment
tnc = int(n_cols / 3)
self.x = random.randint(tnc - 1, (2 * tnc) - 1)
tnr = int(n_rows / 3)
self.y = random.randint(tnr - 1, (2 * tnr) - 1)
self.store = 0
</code></pre><P>Change model.py so that environment is passed in correctly as
agents are initialised.
</P>
<P>In the Agent class define the following method:</P>
<pre><code class="language-python">
def eat(self):
    if self.environment[self.y][self.x] &gt;= 10:
        self.environment[self.y][self.x] -= 10
        self.store += 10
</code></pre><P>This method checks the value of the 'environment' where the
agent is located and if this is greater than or equal to 10,
the value of 'environment' where the agent is located is reduced
by 10, and 10 is added to the 'store' attribute of the agent.
</P>
<P>Write a docstring for the 'eat' method.</P>
<P>In 'model.py' call the 'eat' method  after the move function and
run the program. Some values of 'environment' around where the
agents are should have changed, but this is difficult to see in
the plot.
</P>
<P>Change the plot limits for a closer look at the centre of the
environment as follows:
</P>
<pre><code class="language-python">
plt.ylim(y_max / 3, y_max * 2 / 3)
plt.xlim(x_max / 3, x_max * 2 / 3)
</code></pre><P>Run the program again and you should get the following image:
<img src="../../resources/abm5/Figure_4.png"
alt="A plot of agents on a limited part of the environment with
part of it eaten away and the agents centralised." />
</P>
<P>Note that two of the agents have moved to the right beyond the
limited area.
</P>
<P>Increase 'n_iterations' to 100 and run again and you should get
the following image:
<img src="../../resources/abm5/Figure_5.png"
alt="A plot of agents on a limited part of the environment with
part of it eaten away." />
</P>
<P>Note the checkered effect caused by the 'environment' being
eaten away. The checkering is a consequence of the way agents
move and eat.
</P>
<P>Add and commit to your local git repository and assuming you are
using GitHub - push your changes to GitHub.
</P>
</DIV>

<DIV>
<H2 id="5">5. Further Assignment 1 Coding Tasks</H2>
<P>In the eat method of the Agent class, detail an 'else' clause of
the 'if' statement so that if the value of 'environment' where
the agent is located is less than or equal to 10 then what is
there is removed and added to the store of the agent. Test this
works and write a few sentences about the testing in a document.
</P>
<P>Define a function in 'model.py' that adds up all the values in
environment.
</P>
<P>Define another function that adds up all the store values in
all the agents.
</P>
<P>Print out these sums and check that the total amount of
resource and store in the system is not changing after each
iteration of the model.
</P>
<P>Write a function called 'write_data' in 'io.py' to write out
the values of environment to a file and call this function after
the main model loop.
</P>
<P>Add and commit to your local git repository and assuming you are
using GitHub - push your changes to GitHub.
</P>
</DIV>

<DIV>
<H2 id="6">6. Code Review and Looking Forward</H2>
<P>Consider what happens when two or more agents are at the same
location and there is less resource at the location for all the
agents to have 10: Those agents processed sooner will get to eat
more resource. And, if agents are always processed in the same
order, then there will be bias in favour of these agents gaining
more store... Write a comment in your source code about this.
